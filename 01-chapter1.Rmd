## CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION

There are an estimated 322 million people in the world living with Major Depressive Disorder [MDD; @worldhealthorganizationDepressionOtherCommon2017], which marks an 18.4% increase from 2005 to 2015 [@worldhealthorganizationDepressionOtherCommon2017].
This is compounded by increases in mental illness due to the current global pandemic [@twengeCensusBureauassessedPrevalence2020]. 
Depression is associated with decrements in interpersonal relationships, poor work performance and burnout, and reductions in physical wellbeing [@drussImpairmentRoleFunctioning2009a; @kesslerPrevalenceEffectsMood2006; @lewinsohnPsychosocialFunctioningYoung2003].
Given its ubiquity, the economic impact of depression is profound.
Depression is associated with higher levels of health care utilization and spending [@donohueReducingSocietalBurden2007].
In the United States, loss in work productivity related to depression is estimated to surpass \$36 billion [@kesslerPrevalenceEffectsMood2006].
The cost associated with “presenteeism” (i.e., being present at work with depression) is estimated to be \$5524 per person in the United States [@evans-lackoGlobalPatternsWorkplace2016].
The impacts of MDD are far reaching, and more effective treatments will improve quality of life and ease economic burden. 

Current treatments for depression are frequently ineffective. 
Approximately 45-65% of those with depression undergoing CBT do not achieve remission [@derubeisCognitiveTherapyVs2005; @dimidjianRandomizedTrialBehavioral2006].
Treatment outcomes for depression suggest that even after completion of therapy, 29% of individuals relapse within one year following treatment and 54% do so within two years [@vittenglReducingRelapseRecurrence2007].
Depression is currently a highly intractable disorder with a high rate of recurrence and relapse.
Mainstream treatments for depression largely focus on mitigating symptoms associated with negative emotions [@argyropoulosAnhedoniaRevisitedThere2013; @beckCognitiveTherapyEmotional1979].
However, patients undergoing treatment typically equally emphasize the importance of bolstering positive emotions as they do reducing negative emotion [@demyttenaereWhatImportantBeing2015].
Other research further illustrates unique relations among positive emotion and depression symptoms while adjusting for the effects of negative emotion [@dunnChangesPositiveNegative2019; @kahrilasSavoringMomentLink2020]. 
Moving forward, translational research that strives to facilitate development of evidence-based strategies targeting impairments in positive emotion in depression could be critical to improving the low treatment outcome rate in depression.

In order to contribute to informing the development of neuroscience-based interventions that bolster the experience of positive emotions for individuals with depression, I conducted a trio of studies aimed to investigate personality traits and neural correlates associated with positive emotion reactivity and regulation within the context of depression. First, I investigated relations among individual differences pertaining to the experience of positive emotion (i.e., positive affectivity and savoring) and how they relate to depression symptomatology. This initial line of inquiry elucidated possible modifiable psychological mechanisms in treating depression for individuals with depression and low disposition to experience positive emotions. Next, we addressed fundamental questions regarding the neural temporal course of emotion reactivity and regulation. This highlighted differences and similarities in the  reactivity and regulation across positive and negative emotion, which is key information in developing targeted neuroscience-informed interventions for forms of transdiagnostic psychopathology symptoms characterized by dysregulation emotion reactivity and regulation. Finally, informed by findings in the previous two studies, I investigated relations among the neural temporal course of emotion reactivity and personality traits relevant to the experience of positive emotion in depression. This work identified potential neural mechanisms supporting dysregulated emotion reactivity in depression that may be an intervention target for those with low positive affectivity in depression.

### Overview of Study One, Savoring the moment: A link between affectivity and depression

The first study, “Savoring the moment: A link between affectivity and depression,” which was published in the International Journal of Wellbeing [@kahrilasSavoringMomentLink2020], investigated the relations among affectivity (negative and positive), savoring, and depression.
More specifically, it investigated the mediating role of the temporal domains of savoring (anticipating, savoring the moment, reminiscing) in the relation between factors of Clark and Watson’s tripartite model (Positive Affectivity, PA, and Negative Affectivity, NA) and depression.
Participants ($N$ = 1,618) completed questionnaires measuring PA, NA, savoring capacity, and depression.
A path analysis was conducted with PA and NA as exogenous variables, the three temporal domains of savoring as mediators, and depression the outcome. Worry, sex, and anxious arousal were included as covariates for all paths.

Overall, the findings from this study indicated that PA and NA were associated with depression as well as all three savoring temporal domains.
This suggests that all temporal domains of savoring may bolster PA and mitigate NA.
Notably, momentary savoring distinctly mediated the relationship between both PA and NA and depression, suggesting that  momentary savoring may reduce depression symptoms in individuals with low PA and high NA.

This study underscored the importance of enhancing momentary awareness and upregulation of positive emotions in managing depression. Increased attention to positive stimuli is likely one mechanism through which savoring influences depression symptoms [@carlPositiveEmotionRegulation2013].
While there are distinctions between savoring and mindfulness [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007], the importance of moment-to-moment awareness in treating depression is corroborated by the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions [@guHowMindfulnessbasedCognitive2015a].
Study One supports the importance of momentary awareness in treating depression in those with low PA, but its use of cross-sectional data precluded causal inference.
Further, it did not disentangle the neural time course of positive emotion reactivity and regulation and how these concepts related to individual differences (i.e., PA and savoring capacity), which is crucial to devise neuroscience-informed interventions for those with anhedonic depression.
Studies Two and Three were conducted to address these gaps.

### Overview of Study Two, Neural Chronometry of Positive and Negative Emotion Reactivity and Regulation

In order to extend findings from Study One, Study Two addressed fundamental questions regarding the neural time course of emotion reactivity and regulation. This study implemented a temporal principal components approach (PCA) to investigate the temporal course of enhancement and attenuation of neural response to positive and negative valenced affective images in a non-selected sample (N = 54). Certain ERP components are well established in emotion regulation literature (i.e., LPP), while other earlier visual components (i.e., N170 & EPN) are not. I examined these earlier ERP components with a PCA approach in order to provide a more holistic view on potentially critical windows of neural processing involved in emotion reactivity and regulation, with the ultimate goal of eventually identifying modifiable neural mechanisms in order to ameloriate depression symptoms. The questions of how emotion reactivity relates to depression symptoms remains unanswered, however. This was the focus of Study Three.

### Overview of Study Three, Neural Correlates of the Brightening Effect in Depression

Building on findings from Study One and Study Two, Study Three aimed to investigate the relations among low PA in depression and the neural time course of emotion reactivity. 
To this end, participants (*n* = 80) endorsing clinically significant levels of depression were recruited and completed batteries of questionnaires (including measures of depression and PA). 
Additionally, EEG data was collected using the same experimental paradigm validated in Study Two. 
Research suggests that the relation between neural correlates of emotion reactivity and depression vary as a function of depression severity [e.g., @demenescuNeuralCorrelatesPerception2011; @weinbergDecreasedNeuralResponse2017].
Thus, the samples from Study Two (unselected sample) and Study Three (recruited on the basis of depression symptoms) will be harmonized, resulting in a sample with greater variability in depression symptoms.
This study will seek to compare different models of emotion reactivity in depression by using structural equation modeling. 
Relations among depression symptoms and emotion reactivity were analyzed to determine how neural correlates of emotion reactivity vary depending on depression severity. 
I hypothesized that positive and negative emotion reactivity across ERP components derived from a temporal PCA would be associated with PA. 
More specifically, reduced levels of PA would be associated with blunted ERP activity in a manner congruent with the ECI view. 
Further, we tested whether this model would outperform other competing models of emotion reactivity as informed by a previous study (Hill et al., 2019). 
This study aims to advance knowledge regarding impairments in emotion reactivity for individuals with depression as well as inform potential intervention targets. 
This research will serve as a foundational step for future studies focused on investigating positive emotion regulation and the modification of positive emotion regulation in individuals with depression.
