### Positive Affectivity Influences Wellbeing
Positive affectivity (PA) refers to one's disposition to experience positive affect, or more transient positive emotions (e.g., happiness, interest, energy, and self-assurance) and level of pleasurable engagement with one's environment, [@watsonPositiveAffectivity2009; @watsonPositiveNegativeAffectivity1988; @watsonSpecificityPositiveEmotional2010b] and is theorized to represent a stable individual difference.
PA may be a key variable influencing overall wellbeing, and strong links have been found between PA and health [@cohenPositiveAffectHealth2006].
In the famous nun study, Danner, Snowdon, & Friesen [-@dannerPositiveEmotionsEarly2001] demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between positive emotional content written in personal autobiographies (e.g., “emotion sentences” coded for affective states such as happiness, love, gratefulness, etc.) and mortality, above and beyond the influence of negative emotional content. Other studies also indicate that PA is related to lower rates of strokes among the elderly [@ostirAssociationEmotionalWellbeing2001].
Those reporting a greater tendency to experience positive affect also may have increased resilience to the common cold, even after accounting for the effects associated with negative affect [@cohenEmotionalStyleSusceptibility2003]. 
Research has shown that those suffering from life-threatening disease with decent prospects of survival (e.g., AIDS, coronary heart disease, early-stage breast cancer) show an association between PA and improved health outcomes [@pressmanDoesPositiveAffect2005a]. 
Higher levels of PA have also been associated with improved sleep quality, more exercise, and lower levels of the stress hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol [@cohenPositiveAffectHealth2006]. 
Additionally, PA has been hypothesized to increase levels of hormones and neurotransmitters, such as oxytocin and growth hormone, as well as endogenous opioids [@pressmanDoesPositiveAffect2005a]. 
PA also promotes prosocial behavior, empathy, forming closer relationships, and larger social networks [@morelliNeuralComponentsEmpathy2014], which are factors that positively impact overall health outcomes [@cacioppoLonelinessHealthPotential2002; @cohenPositiveAffectHealth2006].

While negative affectivity (i.e., one's disposition to experience negative affect; NA) is a more general indicator of distress observed across depressive and anxiety disorder and associated with somatic symptoms [@minekaComorbidityAnxietyUnipolar1998; @watsonNegativeAffectivityDisposition1984], low PA is theorized be a unique risk factor for depression [@clarkTripartiteModelAnxiety1991; @kendallProspectiveAssociationsLow2015; @lewinsohnPleasantActivitiesDepression1973; @raesDampeningPositiveAffect2012; @watsonTestingTripartiteModel1995; @watsonTestingTripartiteModel1995a].
As such, low PA is associated with compounded depression symptoms [@clarkTripartiteModelAnxiety1991; @davidsonAffectiveStyleAffective1998; @watsonExtraversionPsychopathologyFacetlevel2015].
Indeed, those with depression report reduced mood shifting in response to positive film clips, as well as an attenuated startle response (theorized to be an indicator of emotional reactivity) to positive and negative film clips [@kavianiAffectiveModulationStartle2004].
Underscoring its trait-like nature, PA is resistant to most major life events influencing wellbeing; there is a tendency to revert back to baseline levels of PA in the long term [@suhEventsSubjectiveWellbeing1996; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009].
Related, the presence of positive life events alone do not modify depressive symptoms [@needlesPositiveLifeEvents1990].
Possible mechanisms between the relationship between depression and the interpretation and experience of positive events include cognitive style [@needlesPositiveLifeEvents1990] and neural factors [@watsonPositiveAffectivity2009].
As such, advancing the neuroscientific understanding of PA has the potential to facilitate the development of intervention strategies that promote wellbeing for individuals with psychological and medical disorders.

### Neural Correlates of Positive Affectivity
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research indicates enhanced blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) changes predominately in the right occipital cortex [i.e., fusiform cortex, lateral occipital cortex, & medial parietal cortex; @bradleyActivationVisualCortex2003], as well as the amygdala and visual cortex [@sabatinelliParallelAmygdalaInferotemporal2005] in response to affective (pleasant and unpleasant) compared to neutral images.
These BOLD signal changes are correlated with emotional arousal ratings of affective stimuli irrespective of valence.
Indeed, the greatest changes in brain activity are observed for highly arousing stimuli, such as mutilations, erotica, and threat, compared to neutral objects [@bradleyBrainPotentialsPerception2007].

Canli and colleagues [-@canliFMRIStudyPersonality2001] investigated the relationship between stable personality traits (extraversion and neuroticism) and neural activation in response to positive and negative emotional stimuli.
Extraversion scores correlated with brain activation in response to positive (relative to negative) pictures in bilateral cortical (frontal and temporal) and subcortical (e.g., amygdala, dorsal striatum) regions.
Neuroticism, on the other hand, correlated with brain activation to negative (relative to positive) images in left temporal and frontal lobes [@canliFMRIStudyPersonality2001].
No correlations were found between extraversion and neural activation in response to negative (relative to positive) pictures [@canliFMRIStudyPersonality2001].
Another related study found that left amygdala activation in response to happy faces was positively correlated with extraversion scores [@canliAmygdalaResponseHappy2002], collectively suggesting that personality traits are associated with neural reactivity to affective stimuli.
These accounts are consistent with behavioral accounts demonstrating an association between positive emotional reactivity and extraversion [@grossFacetsEmotionalExpressivity1995].
PA is highly correlated with extraversion [@costaInfluenceExtraversionNeuroticism1980] and is also marked by more intense episodes of positive affect [@watsonPositiveAffectivity2009].
Thus, it can be hypothesized that those with higher levels of PA may exhibit similar neural affective responsivity reported by Canli and colleagues (2001, 2002).

fMRI methodology has advanced the identification of specific subcortical structures involved in emotion processing, but its low temporal resolution precludes it from being an effective method of measuring neural time course [@kimLimitationsTemporalResolution1997].
In contrast, electroencephalography (EEG) allows for the analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) that facilitate assessment of neural response to affective stimuli with millisecond temporal resolution [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
This is important considering the rapid processing of emotional stimuli that is characteristic of emotional responsivity [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008] and the perception of threatening/arousing events is enabled by a rapid processing pathway that recruits the thalamus and amygdala [@ledouxEmotionCircuitsBrain2000].
Thus, an improved understanding of the temporal course of ERPs evoked by affective stimuli will advance knowledge regarding affective processing [@battyEarlyProcessingSix2003; @codispotiRepetitionEventrelatedPotentials2007; @schuppEmotionAttentionEventrelated2006; @schuppStimulusNoveltyEmotion2006; @smithEventrelatedPotentialCorrelates2004].

Affective EEG research has implicated the late positive potential (LPP), a sustained positive slow wave observed starting as early as 300 ms following stimuli onset, as an established index of evaluative congruency, valence, and arousal in response to visual stimuli [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
Research has consistently shown that LPP over the centroparietal cortex is augmented in the presence of unpleasant and pleasant compared to neutral images [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @dillonDissociationEventrelatedPotentials2006; @fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @hajcakTemporalDynamicsEmotion2007; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
LPP is most pronounced for images that are rated as highly arousing [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007] and, as such, has been theorized to reflect activation of a brain network engaged in processing affective visual stimuli, including subcortical structures, particularly the amygdala [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].

Much of the aforementioned research has utilized the International Affective Picture System [IAPS; @langInternationalAffectivePicture2008].
The IAPS is a set of color pictures that span a range of semantic categories, and valence/arousal ratings derived from a normative sample are provided for each image.
The IAPS was developed to provide a standardized stimulus set of emotional images to facilitate the comparison of results across different studies, and enhance replication across research groups [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007].
IAPS images are rated with respect to valence (negative-to-positive) and arousal (low-to-high) on a nine-point visual analogue scale.
The IAPS has been used in a number of studies investigating neural correlates of affective processing and emotion regulation [e.g., @fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @kimNeuralCorrelatesPositive2007; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
The copyright agreement that accompanies the IAPS mandates that users cannot place any of the images on computer-accessible websites.
This poses considerable restraint on increasing reliance on online samples in behavioral research that make data collection from large and diverse samples faster, less costly, and more efficient [@berinskyEvaluatingOnlineLabor2012; @buhrmesterAmazonMechanicalTurk2011; @krautPsychologicalResearchOnline2004; @masonConductingBehavioralResearch2012; @paolacciRunningExperimentsAmazon2010].
Thus, there is an increasing demand for images with standardized valence and arousal ratings for behavioral researchers to use in online contexts.
Kurdi, Lazano, and Banaji [-@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] heeded this call with the Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS).
The OASIS is a collection of 900 high quality images collected from open-access online sources depicting a range of categories (people, animals, objects, & scenes).
The OASIS was normed on valence and arousal ratings collected from a diverse sample recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
To facilitate experimental control in the selection of stimuli and facilitating comparison of results and replication across different studies using this new image set, the present study utilized OASIS stimuli in lieu of the IAPS.

Replicating previous research, it is expected that OASIS stimuli that are rated as more emotionally arousing will be associated with enhanced LPP activity for both positive and negative images compared to neutral images.
Furthermore, given that a) PA is associated with greater frequency and intensity of positive affect, b) LPP is an established index of emotional arousal, and c) past research has indicated that neural responsivity to positive affective stimuli is correlated with extraversion, it is expected that higher self-reported PA will be associated with enhanced LPP activity in response to positive OASIS stimuli.

## Positive emotion dysregulation in depressive disorders

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychological disorders [@goodwinEpidemiologyMoodDisorders2006]. In the United States, 17% of adults experience at least one major depressive episode during their life [@kesslerLifetimePrevalenceAgeofonset2005]. Depression symptoms are associated with life impairments including interpersonal relationship strain, increased likelihood of poor work performance and burnout, and decreased physical wellbeing [@drussImpairmentRoleFunctioning2009a; @kesslerPrevalenceEffectsMood2006; @lewinsohnPsychosocialFunctioningYoung2003]. In the United States, depression-related loss in work productivity has been estimated to exceed $36 billion [@kesslerPrevalenceEffectsMood2006]. Treatment outcomes for depression suggest that even after the completion of therapy, 54% of individuals relapse within two years following treatment [@vittenglReducingRelapseRecurrence2007]. Depression is currently a highly intractable disorder with a high rate of recurrence and relapse. Translational research that strives to develop a better understanding of factors that contribute to ongoing symptoms and relapse is urgently needed to develop effective treatments. 

Impaired capability to regulate negative emotions is considered a robust feature of depression. Previous emotion regulation research has predominantly focused on downregulating negative emotions to decrease sadness and negative affect and has largely overlooked the role of positive emotion regulation [@joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a]. Yet, above and beyond other depression symptoms, anhedonia (i.e., lack of pleasure) is a hallmark feature of MDD [@americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2013], and may be associated with impairments in positive emotion regulation [@joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a]. Anhedonia negatively impacts daily function, predicts poor treatment response, indicates risk for future depressive episodes, and shows specificity with regard to depression diagnosis [@khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019; @watsonSpecificityPositiveEmotional2010b]. Anhedonia involves abnormal bi-directional reactivity and regulatory affective processes including 1) positive attenuation, or hyporeactivity to positive stimuli [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008; @forbesNeuralSystemsPositive2005] and 2) impaired capability to enhance or upregulate affective responses evoked by positive stimuli [@forbesNeuralSystemsPositive2005]. Broadly defined, emotion regulation refers to the psychological processes that modulate an initial emotional response [@lewisAdvancesProblemsChallenges2010] and implies that a change has occurred from initial reactivity (i.e., baseline affective response to a stimulus). Emerging research on positive emotion dysregulation in depression indicates that impaired regulatory mechanisms may diminish the frequency, duration, intensity, and quality of positive emotions, including difficulties anticipating, initiating, sustaining, or upregulating positive stimuli and experiences [@forbesNeuralSystemsPositive2005; @joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a; @liuSelectionImplementationEmotion2017].

Experiencing positive emotions is paramount to deriving vitality from daily lived experiences. Positive emotions are associated with a range of beneficial intertwined psychological and physical outcomes including longevity, reduced incidents of stroke, improved sleep quality, larger social networks, increased prosocial behavior, lower cortisol levels, and increased endogenous opioids and oxytocin [@siltonRegulatingPositiveEmotions2020a]. However, only limited research has focused on understanding positive emotion regulation within the context of depression. Moving forward, a new focus on developing evidence-based strategies to target impairments in positive emotion regulation in depression could be critical to improving the low treatment outcome rate in depression.

## Savoring strategies upregulate positive emotions in depression. 

Savoring-based regulatory strategies are the most commonly used strategies implemented to sustain and upregulate positive emotions [@heiyBackBasicsNaturalistic2014; @liuSelectionImplementationEmotion2017]. First coined by Bryant (1989), savoring refers to the capacity “to attend to, appreciate, and enhance the positive experience in one’s life” [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007]. People initiate savoring responses in reaction to a positive event or feeling as a way to maintain, intensify, or prolong the initial positive experience [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007]. While savoring, one may eagerly anticipate future positive experiences, focus on ongoing positive experiences as they occur in the present moment, or reminisce about past positive experiences. Regardless of the temporal focus, savoring processes upregulate positive emotions in the present moment. Savoring strategies that amplify positive emotions are associated with greater frequency of positive affect [@smithNurturingCapacitySavor2014] and the capacity to savor is positively associated with extraversion, self-esteem, happiness, and life satisfaction [@bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a]. Correspondingly, lack of savoring capacity is inversely correlated with anhedonia, depression, hopelessness, and neuroticism [@bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a], indicating that the capability to upregulate positive emotions likely involves modifiable processes that are vulnerable to change in depression [@siltonRegulatingPositiveEmotions2020a]. 

With specific relevance to depression, studies aimed at enhancing savoring capacity show that enriching any of the three temporal domains of savoring (reminiscing, savoring the moment, or anticipating) is associated with increased frequency and intensity of positive affect, and decreased negative affect [@bryantDimensionsSubjectiveMental1984; @bryantSavoringNewModel2007]. Training on momentary positive emotion regulation (i.e., memory building, expressing positive emotions) resulted in decreased self-reported depression symptoms when compared to a control group after two weeks [@hurleyResultsStudyIncrease2012]. A savoring intervention study that was conducted in older adults showed that diminished dampening of positive emotions was related to decreased depression symptoms [@smithEffectsSavoringIntervention2017]. Savoring may improve the capability to recognize and enjoy positive moments, even during difficult times [@smithEffectsSavoringIntervention2017]. Positive self-attributions for recent positive events have been associated with attenuated depression symptoms and enhanced positive affect following positive events in a sample of college-aged women [@mcmakinPositiveAffectStimulation2011]. Increased attention to positive stimuli is a candidate psychological mechanism through which positive emotion regulation strategies are theorized to mitigate depression symptoms [@carlPositiveEmotionRegulation2013; @joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a]. 

## Mindfulness-based interventions may increase capacity for positive emotion regulation in individuals with depression. 

While savoring and mindfulness are not analogous, there may be some overlapping conceptual aspects [@bryantAppreciatingLifeMidst2015; @bryantSavoringNewModel2007; @hurleyResultsStudyIncrease2012]. Mindfulness meditation practices and mindfulness-based interventions emphasize the importance of cultivating non-judgmental attention and awareness in the present moment [@guHowMindfulnessbasedCognitive2015a], which may help enhance the capability to savor the moment. Mindfulness meditation is theorized to enhance the capacity for and experience of positive emotions [@garlandMindfulnessBroadensAwareness2015a; @wielgoszMindfulnessMeditationPsychopathology2019a] and ultimately promote wellbeing [@dahlReconstructingDeconstructingSelf2015a], as well as broaden cognitive scope which in turn bolsters the capacity for savoring [@garlandMindfulnessBroadensAwareness2015a]. Mindfulness meditation practices may modify positive valence systems through enhanced emotion awareness, modulations in emotional reactivity, increased use of cognitive reappraisal, and alterations in reward processes [@wielgoszMindfulnessMeditationPsychopathology2019a]. Along with increasing attention and awareness toward positive experiences as they occur, positive reappraisal may be a key emotion regulation mechanism related to mindfulness meditation practice that reduces stress and depression symptoms [@garlandMindfulnessBroadensAwareness2015a].

Headspace is the top-rated mindfulness app per psyberguide.org. It is also scalable and cost-effective. Additionally, out of 23 commonly used mindfulness-based mental health apps, researchers awarded Headspace with the highest rating on the Mobile Application Rating Scale, which assesses app engagement, functionality, aesthetics, information quality, and subjective satisfaction [@maniReviewEvaluationMindfulnessBased2015]. Since the onset of this study, Headspace has provided our study team with free three-month Headspace access codes for study participants and they also share all user-data for study participants. Headspace otherwise provides no other financial support for this research. The present study aims to advance our understanding of self-report wellbeing and neurophysiological outcomes that index changes in depression and positive emotion regulation following an eight-week trial of Headspace.

## Establishing the neural correlates of positive emotion regulation. 

Previous affective neuroscience research rarely focused on reaction and response to positive emotion; thus, we presently have a minimal understanding regarding the neural correlates associated with positive emotion regulation, which remains a critical area of research to attend to moving forward15. Our research team conducted an electroencephalography (EEG) study to validate and establish the emotion regulation task used in the present study. This research was fundamental to improving our understanding of the temporal course of the neural correlates of positive emotion reactivity and regulation. We pre-registered this previous EEG study, and consistent with open science practices, we will make the data publicly available (OSF link: [https://osf.io/p5ba9](https://osf.io/pb5ba9)). This research focused on two key event-related potential (ERP) components which provide information about the temporal course of neural activity involved in processing affective stimuli: the early posterior negativity (EPN) and the late positive potential (LPP) in response to positive emotion reactivity and regulation. The EPN represents an early categorization of affective stimuli whereas the LPP is indicative of a later integrated conceptual analysis [@frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019]. LPP is an established index of emotional arousal in response to visual stimuli [@hajcakEventrelatedPotentialsEmotion2010; @sabatinelliParallelAmygdalaInferotemporal2005] and is theorized to index a visual cortical/amygdala pathway that is involved in evaluating the affective salience of a stimuli34. Increased LPP has been associated with increased subjective reports of emotional arousal [@fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008]. Therefore, we expected that the capability to flexibly modulate emotional intensity in response to positive stimuli would be indexed by LPP, which would be associated with increased positive emotion regulation capacity (per self-report). 

Primary study aim: We will evaluate the hypothesis that an eight-week app-based mindfulness meditation intervention will modify neural correlates of positive emotion regulation for individuals with depression symptoms. Building upon emerging research from my laboratory that characterizes patterns of brain activity associated with positive emotion regulation and savoring the moment [@kahrilasSavoringMomentLinkreviseandresubmit], the proposed project will evaluate whether an eight-week Headspace mindfulness intervention modifies the neural correlates of positive emotion regulation in individuals with depression symptoms. Specifically, the proposed study will evaluate whether the capability to modulate emotional intensity in response to positive stimuli (as indexed by EPN and LPP) will be increased for emerging adults with depression following eight weeks of Headspace use. Illustrating proof of concept and feasibility for the proposed research, our preliminary analyses demonstrate that Headspace reduces depression symptoms and increases momentary savoring capacity [@conleyBenefitsMobileMindfulness2019; @siltonPsychologicalNeuralCorrelates2018]. 
Significance

Cultivating the capacity to experience positive emotions via upregulating the experience associated with positive stimuli and moments as they occur is critical to psychological and physical health outcomes. The proposed study will examine indices of neural (EEG) function and their association with positive emotion regulation capabilities in order to identify potential mechanisms. This broad aim is consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative which encourages researchers to integrate across units of analysis in order to better characterize dimensional perspectives on human behavior. Identifying modifiable psychological mechanisms associated with positive emotion regulation is critical to advancing evidence-based therapeutic approaches that promote societal health and wellbeing, particularly in the present milieu of rapidly increasing rates of depression and anxiety disorders [@worldhealthorganizationWorldHealthStatistics2014]. As such, this research has the potential to inform interventions to enhance physical wellbeing and psychological vitality in individuals with medical and psychological disorders, such as depression, postpartum depression, and pain disorders. Furthermore, this project will provide opportunities to mentor graduate and undergraduate research assistants. Through mentoring in human neuroscience research, students will build a broader skill set involving data science, critical thinking, development of innovative ideas, project management, and communication abilities that will prepare them for successful careers in psychological or health sciences.

Researchers have posited that individuals who self-report higher levels of PA may gain more pleasure and exhibit more responsivity to positive stimuli [@grossRelationsAffectPersonality1998; @rustingExtraversionNeuroticismSuceptibility1997]. Previous research investigating the relationship between the personality traits and response to emotional stimuli examined extraversion and neuroticism which are closely related to PA and NA, respectively [@costaInfluenceExtraversionNeuroticism1980; @warrIndependencePositiveNegative1983]. Extraversion is defined as a personality trait associated with sociability, warmth, involvement with people, social participation, activity, and contributes to one’s enjoyment and satisfaction of life [@costaInfluenceExtraversionNeuroticism1980]. Neuroticism is associated with proneness to guilt, anxiety, psychosomatic concerns, worry, and may predispose one to suffer more from one’s misfortunes [@costaInfluenceExtraversionNeuroticism1980]. Gross and colleagues @grossRelationsAffectPersonality1998 observed a positive relationship between extraversion and increases in state positive affect after viewing a positive film clip. No relationship was found between extraversion and changes in state negative affect after viewing a negative film clip [@grossRelationsAffectPersonality1998]. Thus, those reporting higher PA may be deriving more pleasure from positive stimuli, which is consistent with reports of more frequent and intense episodes from those endorsing higher levels of PA [@watsonPositiveAffectivity2009]. These results are also in line with the notion that low levels of extraversion and neuroticism do not appear to reduce unpleasantness of adverse circumstances and diminish joy, respectively [@costaInfluenceExtraversionNeuroticism1980]. Overall, this suggests that extraversion and neuroticism may have distinct effects on relatively dissociable affective systems.

The aforementioned fMRI studies have focused on identifying specific brain regions involved in emotion regulation by examining static portraits of BOLD signals accumulating over the course of several seconds. Tracking how neural activation unfolds and changes over time is essential in better characterizing the process of emotion regulation and delineating which structures activate concomitantly with reactive and regulatory processes [@hajcakTemporalDynamicsEmotion2007]. To this end of characterizing the processing stages, or neural time course, of emotion regulation, EEG is an ideal method to use since it measures near-instantaneous activity of cortical activation [@hajcakTemporalDynamicsEmotion2007].
