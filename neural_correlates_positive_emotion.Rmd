Healthy emotion regulation abilities are integral to wellbeing [@grossEmergingFieldEmotion1998; @grossEmotionRegulationMental1995; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009; @sapolskyStressStressrelatedDisease2007].
Emotion regulation refers to individuals’ attempts to influence their emotional states [@carlPositiveEmotionRegulation2013], including modulation of positive and negative affective states that are emotionally arousing [@koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009].
This also includes attenuating upsetting, or enhancing positive aspects of a situation [@grossEmergingFieldEmotion1998].
Poor emotion regulation strategies are associated with worsened social functioning [i.e., avoidance of close relationships, few positive relationships, and disinclination to share emotions with others; @grossAntecedentandResponsefocusedEmotion1998; @grossEmotionRegulationAffective2002; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009], as well as lower self-esteem and life satisfaction [@grossAntecedentandResponsefocusedEmotion1998; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009; @ochsnerRethinkingFeelingsFMRI2002].
Poor emotion regulation is also associated with bullying and victimization among youth [@walcottRelationDisinhibitionEmotion2004], physical ailments such as hypertension and coronary heart disease [@hintonMechanismsEfficacyCBT2009; @jorgensenElevatedBloodPressure1996], exacerbated cortisol reactivity to stressors [@wirtzLowSocialSupport2006], and impaired cognitive functioning [@keenanEmotionDysregulationRisk2000; @ochsnerRethinkingFeelingsFMRI2002].

While emotion regulation is often studied in the context of negative emotion, it also pertains to modulating positive emotion.
Savoring refers to an awareness of positive experiences and the use of positive emotion regulation strategies to enhance and extend positive feelings that are derived from those experiences [@bryantFourfactorModelPerceived1989; @bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a; @bryantSavoringNewModel2007; @bryantUnderstandingProcessesThat2011; @smithSavoringWellbeingMapping2017].
People initiate savoring responses in reaction to a positive event or affect as a way to maintain, intensify, or prolong the initial positive experience [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007].
While savoring, one may reminisce about past positive experiences, focus on ongoing positive experiences as they occur, or anticipate the enjoyments of future positive experiences [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007].
Regardless of the temporal focus, savoring processes regulate positive emotions in the present moment.

Savoring is associated with a number of positive outcomes.
Research has indicated that those with a greater capacity to savor possess increased life satisfaction, affective intensity, and self-esteem [@bryantUnderstandingProcessesThat2011].
Past research has also revealed that savoring is related to present happiness, total percent of time feeling happy versus sad, extraversion, optimism, and self-esteem.
Furthermore, savoring is negatively associated with depression, neuroticism, and hopelessness [@bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a; @eisnerPositiveAffectRegulation2009; @houSavoringModeratesAssociation2016; @kahrilasSavoringMomentLink2020; @ramseyAgeDifferencesSubjective2014; @smithSavoringResiliencePsychological2015].
A separate study found that savoring the moment is related to higher life satisfaction, subjective happiness, and overall higher levels of positive affect [@hurleyResultsStudyIncrease2012].
Other research has similarly revealed that savoring was strongly related to higher levels of present happiness, higher self-esteem, and lower reported levels of depression [@bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a].
Further, increased savoring capacity is associated with pain resilience [@thongBufferingRolePositive2016].

The original conceptual formulation of savoring [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007] is predicated on the assumption that people typically initiate savoring responses in reaction to positive events or affect, which people regulate through cognitive or behavioral strategies. 
Thus, difficulties processing positive emotions and events precludes the ability to savor; one's ability to *regulate* positive emotion is based on the assumption that one is able to *react* and attend to positive emotion.
Emotion reactivity broadly refers to an individual's response when an emotion arises, which spans subjective feelings, behavioral manifestation, and bodily reactions [@grossEmotionRegulationConceptual2007]. 
Emotion reactivity varies in arousal (not arousing to strongly arousing) and valence [negative to positive; @grossEmotionEmotionRegulation2014].
Emotion regulation pertains to the manner in which individuals influence their emotions, as well as when and how they are experienced [@grossEmergingFieldEmotion1998].
While savoring is a trait-like measure of one's ability to regulate positive emotions, positive affectivity (PA) pertains to one's reactivity to positive emotions, or the ability tp recognize and attend to positive emotions [@watsonPositiveAffectivity2009]. 
PA is indicative of one's disposition to experience state positive affect, or transient positive emotions (e.g., happiness, interest, energy, and self-assurance) and level of pleasurable engagement with one's environment, [@watsonPositiveAffectivity2009; @watsonPositiveNegativeAffectivity1988; @watsonSpecificityPositiveEmotional2010b] and is theorized to represent a stable trait-like individual difference.

PA may be a key variable influencing overall wellbeing, and strong links have been found between PA and health [@cohenPositiveAffectHealth2006].
Higher levels of PA have also been associated with improved sleep quality, more exercise, and lower levels of the stress hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol [@cohenPositiveAffectHealth2006]. 
Additionally, PA has been hypothesized to increase levels of hormones and neurotransmitters, such as oxytocin and growth hormone, as well as endogenous opioids [@pressmanDoesPositiveAffect2005a]. 
PA also promotes prosocial behavior, empathy, cultivating closer relationships, and cultivating larger social networks [@morelliNeuralComponentsEmpathy2014], all of which are factors that positively impact overall health outcomes [@cacioppoLonelinessHealthPotential2002; @cohenPositiveAffectHealth2006].

Since higher levels of PA and savoring are related to enhanced wellbeing [@cohenPositiveAffectHealth2006; @smithEffectsSavoringIntervention2019; @smithNurturingCapacitySavor2014; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009], these may be critical factors to target in treatments for individuals with depression.
45-65% of those with depression undergoing common treatments for depression (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy and psychotropics; @priceNeurocircuitryMoodDisorders2010a) do not achieve remission [@derubeisCognitiveTherapyVs2005].
These frequently used evidence-based interventions largely focus on mitigating problems associated with negative emotions [@argyropoulosAnhedoniaRevisitedThere2013; @beckCognitiveTherapyEmotional1979].
While these are important areas to address, negative *and* positive emotion processes are both uniquely associated with depression [@dunnChangesPositiveNegative2019; @kahrilasSavoringMomentLink2020].
Given the unique contribution and importance of both positive and negative emotion disturbances to the maintenance and severity of depression symptoms, it is problematic that current depression treatments are inadequate in addressing positive emotion.
In fact, positive emotion may be a more pressing intervention target for patients undergoing depression treatment [@dunnChangesPositiveNegative2019].
As such, novel treatments aim to reduce the use of dampening appraisal (a theorized psychological mechanism of reduced PA; @dunnTurningGoldLead2018).
Advancing our understanding of the neural correlates of PA and savoring may facilitate neuroscience-informed clinical interventions that mitigate depression.

# Neural Time Course of Positive Affective Processing
While theoretical distinctions have been drawn between emotion reactivity and regulation, there is little extant literature that has investigated the distinct time course of these processes, particularly for positive emotion.
Different psychological ailments may manifest as disordered emotion reaction and/or regulation that may be important considerations in devising interventions.
For example, those with posttraumatic stress disorder show irregular affective processing in both emotional reactivity to and regulation of negative visual stimuli [@fitzgeraldNeuralIndicesEmotional2018].
Depression is associated with attenuated emotional reactivity to affective stimuli [e.g., @fotiReducedElectrocorticalResponse2010; @weinbergDepressionReducedNeural2016] and ineffective regulation efforts that are marked by reduced recruitment of structures implicated in cognitive control and attention allocation [@pietrekNeuromagneticIndicationDysfunctional2012].
Disentangling the affective processing implicated by reactivity and regulation is a task that electroencephalography (EEG) is well suited. 
EEG allows for the analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) that facilitate assessment of neural responses to affective stimuli with millisecond temporal resolution [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
This is important considering that the rapid processing of emotional stimuli is characteristic of emotional responsivity [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008] and the perception of threatening/arousing events is enabled by a rapid processing pathway that recruits the thalamus and amygdala [@ledouxEmotionCircuitsBrain2000]. 
Developing a better understanding of the temporal course of ERPs evoked by affective stimuli will advance knowledge regarding affective processing [@battyEarlyProcessingSix2003; @codispotiRepetitionEventrelatedPotentials2007; @flaischAffectivePrimeTarget2008a; @schuppEmotionAttentionEventrelated2006; @smithEventrelatedPotentialCorrelates2004].

## Early Visual Components
The N170 and early posterior negativity (EPN) are early visual EEG components that are modulated by affective stimuli [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].
The N170 is a negative peak occurring approximately 170 ms following stimulus presentation at bilateral occipito-temporal sites [@blauFacespecificN170Component2007] and is thought to reflect rapid structural encoding of faces, with negative N170 amplitude associated with threat-related and positive facial expressions compared to neutral facial expressions [@blauFacespecificN170Component2007; @dasilvaDissociatingNeuralTime2016; @stockdaleInfluenceStimulusValence2020].
Enhanced (i.e., more negative) N170 amplitude has also been observed in response to negatively-valenced complex affective images (i.e., IAPS; @bekhterevaAttentionalBiasAffective2015), albeit with a later peak latency compared to face stimuli (160 - 200 ms for face stimuli and 200 - 240 ms for IAPS).
Thus, it was hypothesized that highly arousing positive and negative OASIS images may elicit more negative N170 relative to neutral visual affective stimuli

The EPN has been observed as a relative negative difference for stimuli as emotionally arousing/valenced compared to neutral stimuli in the 200 - 300 ms window over bilateral occipital-parietal sites [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000; @schuppAttentionEmotionERP2003] with potential sources residing in the occipital cortex and contributions from parietal regions [@wiensNonemotionalFeaturesSuppress2011].
For example, Yoon et al. [-@yoonEnhancedEarlyPosterior2016] found that EPN amplitude in response to happy and fearful faces were augmented (i.e., enhanced negativity) compared to neutral faces among healthy controls.
Further, those with anxiety disorders exhibited greater EPN amplitude in response to fearful compared to happy and neutral faces, suggesting that those with anxiety disorders may have enhanced selective attention for fearful faces [-@yoonEnhancedEarlyPosterior2016].
Other research has observed augmented EPN amplitude in response to pleasant compared to unpleasant complex emotional stimuli, suggesting a "pleasure bias" [@frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019].
EPN has been observed across a variety of different tasks, inter-stimulus intervals (ISI), and stimulus presentation durations [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008], leading researchers to surmise that EPN reflects relatively automatic processes observed even when processing resources are limited due to rapid presentation rates [@junghoferFleetingImagesNew2001; @schuppAttentionEmotionERP2003; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
This sensitivity may index rapid affective amygdala processing of emotionally salient information [@ledouxEmotionCluesBrain1995; @morrisConsciousUnconsciousEmotional1998] and is also theorized to indicate "natural selective attention" where evaluation of image features is contingent upon affectively arousing perceptual characteristics for additional processing [@dolcosEventrelatedPotentialsEmotional2002; @schuppSelectiveProcessingBriefly2004].
Thus, highly arousing positive and negative affective visual stimuli may elicit augmented EPN amplitude relative to neutral visual stimuli.

Some research has indicated that N170 and EPN are sensitive to emotion regulation.
Herbert and colleagues [-@herbertNoFearNo2013] found that EPN signals were significantly attenuated during active downregulation of emotional intensity in response to pictures of fearful faces.
Such effects were not found for downregulation of emotional intensity in response to happy faces [@herbertNoFearNo2013].
Another study analyzed N170 and EPN differences among participants with low and high trait anxiety in an implicit emotion regulation task in response to pictures of facial expressions [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018].
Findings illustrated that implicit emotion regulation processing led to more significant decreases in behavioral negative emotion experience scores, and that these decreases in negative emotion experience scores were correlated with enhanced N170 and EPN amplitude [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018].
Lastly, these enlargements were observed for participants with low trait anxiety but not high trait anxiety, suggesting deficits in implicit emotion regulation among those with anxiety [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018].
However, other research has shown that implicit emotion regulation modifies N170, but not EPN, implicating that implicit emotion regulation may be implemented in earlier perceptual stages of emotion processing rather than later selective attention stages (i.e., EPN & LPP; @wangTemporalCourseImplicit2017).
Given these inconsistent findings and the scarce research investigating the relationship between explicit reappraisal emotion regulation strategies (as utilized in the present study), no hypotheses were made regarding the relationship among regulation conditions (i.e., increasing/decreasing emotional intensity in response to positive/negative images) and N170/EPN. 

Those with higher levels of PA gain more pleasure and exhibit more responsivity to positive stimuli [@grossRelationsAffectPersonality1998; @rustingExtraversionNeuroticismSuceptibility1997].
Previous research has shown relationships between extraversion [a personality trait related to PA; @costaInfluenceExtraversionNeuroticism1980; @warrIndependencePositiveNegative1983; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009] and BOLD response of subcortical structures to positive stimuli [@canliAmygdalaResponseHappy2002; @canliFMRIStudyPersonality2001].
One of the structures implicated in Canli and colleagues' studies (2001, 2002), the amygdala, is also theorized to contribute to N170 and EPN [@vuilleumierDistantInfluencesAmygdala2004].
Research has supported a "pleasure bias" in EPN reactivity, illustrating selective enhanced signals in response to positive stimuli [@frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019].
Additionally, research has drawn associations between trait anxiety and N170/EPN [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018], suggesting that these components may be influenced by other trait-like characteristics, such as PA.
Thus, EPN activity in response to positive vs. neutral images may be contingent upon PA.
Considering the fact that N170 and EPN is are theorized to be rather automatic discrimination processes [@pietrekNeuromagneticIndicationDysfunctional2012], no hypotheses were made regarding the relationship between N170/EPN, regulation conditions, and savoring capacity.

## Slow Wave Components
Research using electroencephalography (EEG) has implicated the late positive potential (LPP), a sustained positive slow wave observed starting as early as 300 ms following stimuli onset, as an established index of evaluative congruency, valence, and arousal in response to visual stimuli [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
Research has consistently shown that LPP over the centroparietal cortex is augmented in the presence of unpleasant and pleasant compared to neutral images [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @dillonDissociationEventrelatedPotentials2006; @fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @hajcakTemporalDynamicsEmotion2007; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
LPP is most pronounced for images that are rated as highly arousing [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007] and has been theorized to reflect activation of a brain network engaged in processing affective visual stimuli, including subcortical structures, particularly the amygdala [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003], which is corroborated by considerable input and output connections connecting the visual cortex to amygdaloid nuclei in primates [@amaralAnatomicalOrganizationPrimate1992].
Past research utilizing EEG has indicated that higher arousal in response to stimuli yields augmented LPP amplitude [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000; @thiruchselvamTemporalDynamicsEmotion2011; @trittIdeologicalReactivityPolitical2016].
Considering that PA is associated with more positive emotional arousal [@grossRelationsAffectPersonality1998; @rustingExtraversionNeuroticismSuceptibility1997; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009], it was hypothesized that the relationship between LPP amplitude and viewing positive stimuli will be dependent upon levels of PA.

Enhanced LPP has been observed when participants described affective images in more negative (compared to neutral) terms [@fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008] and when participants are instructed to evaluate images in affective (compared to non-affective) conditions [@hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006].
Other research has shown reduced LPP when participants suppressed emotional intensity in response to viewing highly arousing affective images [e.g., @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
However, research has not reliably demonstrated that LPP is enhanced when participants are instructed to enhance their emotional intensity in response to negative [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] and positive [@krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008] affective stimuli.
Methodological factors might be contributing to these findings, such as inconsistent stimulus presentation durations, utilization of non-blocked vs. blocked designs, and different offline filter settings.
In addition, trait measures such as savoring capacity may explain additional variance in affective neural processing as suggested by previous fMRI research finding correlations between personality trait measures and neural activation in response to emotional stimuli [@canliAmygdalaResponseHappy2002; @canliFMRIStudyPersonality2001].
LPP is theorized to be indicative of an interaction between amygdala and cognitive control structures [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] as indicated by LPP amplitude being sensitive to reappraisal efforts [e.g., reduced LPP amplitude in response to reappraising negative visual stimuli; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
Furthermore, savoring capacity is positively associated with affect intensity and is indicative of one’s ability to bolster positive emotion [@bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a].
Therefore, higher self-report ratings of one’s capacity to savor were expected to moderate the relationship between LPP and increased emotional intensity in response to positive stimuli.

Research has indicated enhanced frontal LPP as an index of increased cognitive effort [@bernatEffectsInstructedEmotion2011; @moserNeuralMarkersPositive2014; @shafirEmotionalIntensityInfluences2015]. 
Moser et al. (2014) and Shafir et al. (2015) both observed augmented frontal LPP at Fz electrode sites when positively reappraising relative to passively watching negative images in the 800 ms - 1100 ms time window. 
Bernat and colleagues (2011) also observed enhanced right frontal LPP in response to suppression and enhancement conditions in response to negative stimuli. 
In the context of emotion regulation, frontal LPP is only observed while using positive reappraisal strategies rather than distraction [@shafirEmotionalIntensityInfluences2015].
In other words, frontal LPP appears to be contingent upon cognitive exertion, which is underscored by research observing recruitment of frontal neural structures (PFC and ACC) during control efforts [@millerIntegrativeTheoryPrefrontal2001; @ochsnerBetterWorseNeural2004]. 
While extant literature has not investigated frontal LPP in the context of positive images, research suggests that similar frontal processes are engaged in response to regulating emotion in response to positive and negative images [@kimNeuralCorrelatesPositive2007]. 
Thus, it was hypothesized that enhanced frontal LPP would be observed during regulation conditions relative to passive watch conditions (i.e., increasing/decreasing compared to passively watching for both positive and negative stimuli).
However, it was not predicted that frontal LPP would vary between passive watch conditions (i.e., passively viewing positive, negative, or neutral images) since observation of this component appears predicated on the engagement of frontal regions implicated in attention control.

# Self-Report Ratings
In addition to EEG components, research has shown that affective visual stimuli are associated with increased arousal and valence self-report ratings [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
Thus, it is hypothesized that passively viewing negative and positive images compared to neutral images will result in heightened arousal ratings, as well as decreased (for negative images) and increase (for positive images) valence ratings.
Further, it is expected that regulation conditions will result in behavioral ratings consonant with the regulatory goal.
Neural affective picture processing research has demonstrated a reduction in self-report ratings of arousal and valence when participants are tasked with reappraising negative visual stimuli [e.g., @thiruchselvamTemporalDynamicsEmotion2011].
Arousal ratings will be heightened for increase conditions and lowered for decrease conditions. Valence ratings will be more neutral during decrease conditions and more negative when increasing emotional intensity in response to negative images and more positive when increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images relative to passive watch conditions, respectively.
Last, trait measures of PA and savoring capacity are associated with heightened arousal and more positive affect in response to reacting to and upregulating positive emotion, respectively [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009].
Thus, it was hypothesized that the difference in behavioral/valence ratings between passively watching positive vs. neutral images would be positively moderated by PA and the difference in behavioral/valence ratings between increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images vs. passively watching positive images would be positive moderated by savoring capacity.
<!-- The degree to which self-report ratings correspond with EEG components may offer additional insight into the constructs that these EEG components represent -->

# Facilitating Reproducibility with Open Access Stimuli
Much of the aforementioned research has utilized the International Affective Picture System [IAPS; @langInternationalAffectivePicture2008].
The IAPS is a set of color pictures that span a range of semantic categories, and valence/arousal ratings derived from a normative sample are provided for each image.
The IAPS was developed to provide a standardized stimulus set of emotional images to facilitate the comparison of results across different studies, and enhance replication across research groups [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007].
IAPS images are rated with respect to valence (negative-to-positive) and arousal (low-to-high) on a nine-point visual analogue scale.
The IAPS has been used in a number of studies investigating neural correlates of affective processing and emotion regulation [e.g., @fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @kimNeuralCorrelatesPositive2007; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
The copyright agreement that accompanies the IAPS mandates that users cannot place any of the images on computer-accessible websites.
This poses considerable restraint on increasing reliance on online samples in behavioral research that make data collection from large and diverse samples faster, less costly, and more efficient [@berinskyEvaluatingOnlineLabor2012; @buhrmesterAmazonMechanicalTurk2011; @krautPsychologicalResearchOnline2004; @masonConductingBehavioralResearch2012; @paolacciRunningExperimentsAmazon2010].
Thus, there is an increasing demand for images with standardized valence and arousal ratings for behavioral researchers to use in online contexts.
Kurdi, Lazano, and Banaji [-@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] heeded this call with the Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS).
The OASIS is a collection of 900 high quality images collected from open-access online sources depicting a range of categories (people, animals, objects, & scenes).
The OASIS was normed on valence and arousal ratings collected from a diverse sample recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
To facilitate experimental control in the selection of stimuli and facilitating comparison of results and replication across different studies using this new image set, the present study utilized OASIS stimuli in lieu of the IAPS.

# The present study
The present study utilized an experimental paradigm consisting of seven blocks of images using 120 different OASIS stimuli. 40 images were highly-arousing positive images, 40 images were highly-arousing negative images, and 40 were neutral. 
Participants were tasked with increasing or decreasing emotional intensity in response to (i.e., upregulating or downregulating) positive and negative images, as well as passively watching them. 
Participants also passively viewed the block of 40 neutral images.
Following each block of images, participants were asked to rate on a seven-point scale how positive or negative they feel (valence), the intensity of the emotion they feel (arousal), as well as how difficult the regulation task was (difficulty).
The present study had two primary objectives.
The first objective of the proposed study was to replicate previous research using the IAPS with the OASIS.
We hypothesized that a) highly arousing positive compared to neutral OASIS stimuli would be associated with enhanced EEG components (N170, EPN, LPP) and self-report ratings (greater arousal, more positive valence ratings) and b) highly arousing negative compared to neutral OASIS stimuli would be associated with enhanced EEG components (N170, EPN, LPP) and self-report ratings (greater arousal and more negative valence ratings).
Related, it was also hypothesized that LPP amplitude would be modulated in a manner congruent with the regulatory goal.
More specifically, reduction of LPP amplitude would be observed in decrease conditions compared to passive watch conditions, and increased LPP amplitude would be observed in increase conditions compared to passive watch conditions.
Additionally, it was predicted that frontal LPP amplitude would be increased for all regulation conditions (increase and decrease), though not modulated for passive watch conditions.
The second objective was to examine the relationship between personality traits pertaining to positive emotion and EEG components/self-report ratings.
It was predicted that a) PA would moderate the relationship between watching positive images and EEG components (N170, EPN, LPP) as well as self-report ratings (increased arousal and more positive valence ratings) and b) savoring capacity would moderate the relationship between increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images and LPP amplitude as well as self-report ratings (increased arousal and more positive valence-ratings). 

Hypotheses pertaining to modulation of LPP amplitude in response to passively viewing OASIS images and personality traits interacting with LPP amplitude and PA/savoring capacity were preregistered (link: [https://osf.io/p5ba9/](https://osf.io/p5ba9/)).
Other hypotheses were not pre-registered due to transition in lab policies and reanalysis of data collected in the present study.
Thus, other analyses should be considered exploratory and be interpreted with caution.

# Specific Aims and Hypotheses
1. *Examine the relationship between EEG components of interest/behavioral ratings and highly arousing OASIS stimuli*. It is hypothesized that highly arousing positive and negative images will be associated with enhanced N170, EPN, and LPP. Further, it is hypothesized that highly arousing positive and negative images will be associated with arousal and valence behavioral ratings.
2. *Examine EEG component/behavioral rating contrasts among regulatory conditions for positive and negative OASIS stimuli*. It is hypothesized that, relative to passive watch conditions for positive and negative image blocks, there will be modulations in LPP and behavioral ratings that are consistent with the regulatory goal (e.g., enhanced and attenuated LPP in increase and decrease conditions, respectively). In contrast, it is hypothesized that there will be enhancements in frontal LPP for all regulation conditions relative to passive watch conditions. No hypotheses were made regarding N170 and EPN, though these analyses will be conducted in an exploratory manner.
3. *Examine the role of trait measures pertaining positive emotion in neural affective processing of affective visual stimuli*. It is hypothesized that the difference in N170, EPN, LPP, and behavioral ratings between watching neutral images and watching positive images will vary depending on PA. It is also hypothesized that the difference in LPP and behavioral ratings between watching positive images and increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images will vary depending on savoring capacity. No hypotheses were made regarding N170, EPN, and frontal LPP, though these analyses will be conducted in an exploratory manner.

## Method 
### Participants
54 participants were recruited for the study, two of which were excluded due to missing EEG or questionnaire data (*n* = 29 women, *n* = 2 non-binary).
Two additional outlier data points for LPP and frontal LPP in positive increase and negative watched conditions were omitted based on visual inspection of histograms of QQ plots.
Participants ranged in age from 18-29 (*M* = 19.84 years, *SD* = 1.95).
The sample was 70.6% Caucasian, 17.6% Asian, 2.0% Black or African American, and 7.8% multiracial (2.0% declined to answer); 9.8% reported that they were Hispanic/Latino and 90.2% were not Hispanic/Latino.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and informed consent was provided to all participants prior to beginning the experiment.

### Materials and Procedure
#### Questionnaire Measures
Participants were asked to complete the trait Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) to assess for PA ($\omega = .89$).
Participants also completed the Savoring Beliefs Inventory (SBI; Bryant, 2009).
The SBI measures the perception of one’s ability to feel pleasure through anticipating positive outcomes ($\omega = .88$), savoring positive moments ($\omega = .85$), and reminiscing about past positive events ($\omega = .86$; Bryant, 2009).
Only the momentary savoring subscale was used in the following analyses, as this temporal domain was most relevant to the present hypotheses and experimental paradigm.

#### Emotion Task Paradigm
64-channel high-density electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded while participants viewed seven blocks of 40 images (280 total trials).
The study used 120 different Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS) images [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
40 of the images were positive, 40 were neutral, and 40 were negative.
Previous research has shown that 40 trials is sufficient to evoke a reliable late positive potential (LPP) component [@fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
The mean normative valence ratings (on a scale of one to seven) were 5.71, 4.09, and 2.18 for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.
The mean normative arousal ratings (on a scale of one to seven) were 4.46, 1.99, and 4.52, for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.

Each block represented an experimental regulation condition: increase (positive/negative), decrease (positive/negative), and watch (positive/negative/neutral).
During the increase condition, participants were instructed to appraise the picture in a way that will intensify the emotion that is elicited by looking at it.
During the decrease condition, participants were asked to reduce the intensity of the emotion that is elicited by looking at the picture.
When prompted to watch, participants were asked to view the picture as they would naturally.
The passive “watch” blocks served as baseline conditions for LPP component analyses [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
A block design was selected for the proposed study because valenced images outnumber the neutral images two-to-one.
The relatively rare neutral stimuli may produce a P3 if intermixed with valenced stimuli in the same block [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000]. Additionally, LPP signal is increased for stimuli that are perceived as incongruent within a given affective context.
Thus, a neutral stimulus displayed in a series of emotional stimuli would likely evoke an enhanced LPP activity, thus decreasing effect size [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000].
Further, a block design paradigm may better emulate one's natural environment, as stimuli of congruent valence are typically encountered in clusters rather than isolation [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].
Research comparing intermixed and block designs for LPP and EPN have shown comparable findings between the two approaches [@pastorAffectivePicturePerception2008; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].

First, participants completed three practice trials that consisted of 10 images not used during the actual task [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
Participants were instructed to increase or decrease emotional arousal in response to a mixture of positive and negative images, respectively.
Participants were also asked to watch a third practice trial comprised of positive, negative, and neutral images.
Stimuli were presented in random order within each block.
Prior to each practice trial, participants were provided with instructions on how to regulate (increase/decrease) their affective response to the stimuli, or to simply view the stimuli [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
Participants were shown which regulation strategy to engage in (increase, decrease, or watch) at the start of each experimental block.
Once the participant was ready, an OASIS stimulus appeared for 2000 ms [@fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008].
Following stimulus offset, a blank screen appeared for 500 ms followed by a fixation cross for 1500 ms (± 250 ms) for a total ISI of 1750 - 2250 ms (see Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image) for a visual depiction of the experimental paradigm used in the present study).
This interval is identical to other studies utilizing the IAPS and investigating LPP [@dunningSeeNoEvil2009; @hajcakMotivatedControlledAttention2009].
Stimuli within each block were presented in random order.
Each block was separated by a break and presented in pseudo-random order, such that no valence (i.e., positive or negative) nor regulation (i.e., increase, decrease, or watch) condition were presented consecutively.
After each experimental block, valence and arousal ratings were collected using a seven-point likert scale and the same instructions used in Kurdi, Lozano, and Banaji’s [-@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] norming study of the OASIS stimuli set.
Furthermore, difficulty ratings on a seven-point likert scale were also obtained.

### Apparatus and Physiological Recording
Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) was measured while participants completed an emotion regulation task (Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image)).
Participants were seated in a comfortable chair, approximately 24 inches from a 24-inch LCD monitor in a quiet, dimly lit room.
Participants were monitored by a task administrator in a nearby room and received task instructions by intercom.
EEG data were recorded using a Biosemi Active2 EEG system.
A custom-designed Falk Minow 64-channel cap with equidistantly spaced BioSemi active Ag and AgCl electrodes was used for data collection.
CMS/DRL was placed near the vertex, and two electrodes were located on the mastoid bones.
After placement of the electrode cap, electrode positions were digitized.
An additional electrode was placed on the inferior edge of the orbit of each eye to monitor vertical eye movements; nearby electrodes in the cap (lateral to each eye) monitored horizontal eye movements.
Data were recorded with a band pass of 0 – 104 Hz at a sampling rate of 512 Hz.

The following EEG data processing steps were implemented in Brain Electrical Source Analysis software [BESA, Version 7; @schergBESABrainElectric1990].
Following the adaptive artifact correction method [@illeArtifactCorrectionOngoing2002], ocular artifacts were corrected using a spatial PCA filter.
EEG data were re-referenced to the average activity of the mastoid electrodes for LPP analyses [@hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006] and average reference of all electrodes for EPN and N170 analyses [@stockdaleInfluenceStimulusValence2020; @yoonEnhancedEarlyPosterior2016] and digitally filtered with 0.01 Hz high-pass and 30 Hz low-pass filters with a cutoff attenuation of 12 dB/octave
Muscle activity and other artifacts were corrected through implementing an algorithmic scan of continuous EEG data in BESA (fixed threshold criteria: amplitude > 120 uV; gradient > 75 uV, low signal <.01 uV).
Data were baseline-adjusted by subtracting the average activity for 200 milliseconds [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] before stimulus onset.

LPP activity was calculated as the average activity in the 400 – 800 ms window at the Pz electrode site.
Adaptive means for N170 and EPN were computed separately to account for peak latency variability among participants. N170 was defined as the minimum mean-peak amplitude (average amplitude across +/- 15 ms around the peak) between 130 - 200 ms post-stimulus at PO7 and PO8 electrode sites. The EPN was defined as the minimum mean-peak amplitude (average amplitude across +/- 25 ms around the peak) detected between 225 to 325 ms post-stimulus at PO7 and PO8 electrode sites.
Scoring windows and electrode sites were similar to other studies investigating LPP, EPN, and N170 [e.g., @frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @thomEmotionalScenesElicit2014].
The experiment was computer-administered using E-Prime 2.0 software [@schneiderEPrimeUserGuide2002] in order to manipulate the timing and presentation of stimuli.
All stimuli were presented in color and occupied the entirety of the 21-inch monitor.
The viewing distance was approximately 24 in. and occupied 25° of the vertical visual angle and 30° horizontally (Cuthbert et al., 2000; Hajcak & Nieuwenhuis, 2006).

## Analytic Plan
### Preliminary Analyses
Prior to hypothesis testing variables will be evaluated for psychometric and distributional properties.
Descriptive statistics for key variables and demographics will be assessed. 
Bivariate correlations for these variables will also be calculated to assess for relationships between variables. 
Statistical assumptions will be assessed via visual inspection of diagnostic plots (i.e., residual, QQ, scale-location, and residuals vs. leverage) generated with the performance package [@ludeckePerformanceAssessmentRegression2019].

### Analytic Plan for Aim One
A repeated measures analysis variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to assess for differences in relevant EEG components (N170, EPN, LPP) and behavioral ratings among passive watch conditions (neutral, positive and negative). Block type will be entered as the within subject factor and separate analyses will be conducted each with each EEG components and behavioral rating as the outcome. The Tukey method will be used to correct for families of three estimates per analysis.

### Analytic Plan for Aim Two
A repeated measures analysis variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to assess for differences in EEG components (N170, EPN, LPP, frontal LPP) and behavioral ratings among regulation conditions (watch, increase, & decrease) for positive and negative OASIS images. Block type will be entered as the within subject factor and separate analyses will be conducted each with EEG components and behavioral rating as the outcome. The Tukey method will be used to correct for families of three estimates per analysis.

### Analytic Plan for Aim Three
Building upon the previous models, PA will be added as a mean-centered level-two predictor. 
A cross-level interaction will be analyzed between viewing condition and positive affectivity to evaluate whether the relationship between watching positive stimuli (relative to watching neutral stimuli) and EEG components of interest (N170, EPN, LPP)/behavioral ratings significantly vary as a function of positive affectivity. 
To assess whether savoring capacity plays a moderating role in affective neural processing of OASIS stimuli, savoring capacity will be added as a mean-centered level-two predictor. 
The dummy-coded level-one viewing condition variable will be altered so that the positive passive viewing condition will be the reference group. 
A cross-level interaction will be analyzed between viewing condition and savoring capacity to evaluate whether the relationship between increasing emotional intensity in response to positive stimuli (relative to watching positive stimuli) and EEG components of interest (N170, EPN, LPP)/behavioral ratings significantly vary as a function of savoring capacity.

## Power Analysis
Power Calculations were conducted using the G-power [@faulPowerFlexibleStatistical2007] software applications.
Power analyses focused on evaluating differences in LPP amplitudes between viewing conditions (repeated measures ANOVA). 
No prior research has successfully examined significant amplitude differences between watch and increase conditions for positive stimuli.
Therefore, estimates of LPP amplitude differences between watch and suppress conditions for negative stimuli were used from a
study conducted by Moser et al. (2006) to conduct the present power analysis.
Given an
N of 40, we will have 1.0 power to detect a large effect (f = .61; @cohenStatisticalPowerAnalysis1969) of viewing
conditions’ effect on LPP amplitudes. 
Furthermore, an N of 40 will provide .81 power to
detect a large effect [@cohenStatisticalPowerAnalysis1969] of the moderation analysis proposed in hypothesis 2b.
