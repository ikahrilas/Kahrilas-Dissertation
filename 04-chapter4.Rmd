## CHAPTER FOUR: TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING: EPN AND THE "BRIGHTENING EFFECT"

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychological disorders (World Health Organization, 2017). 
In the United States, 17% of adults experience at least one major depressive episode during their life [@kesslerLifetimePrevalenceAgeofonset2005], and it is continuing to increase significantly during the backdrop of a global pandemic [@twengeCensusBureauassessedPrevalence2020]. 
Depression symptoms are associated with challenges in daily life functioning including interpersonal relationship strain, increased likelihood of poor work performance and burnout, and decreased physical wellbeing [@chauvet-gelinierStressAnxietyDepression2017; @drussImpairmentRoleFunctioning2009a; @kesslerPrevalenceEffectsMood2006; @lewinsohnPsychosocialFunctioningYoung2003]. 
In the United States alone, depression-related loss in work productivity has been estimated to exceed $36 billion per year [@kesslerPrevalenceEffectsMood2006]. 
Treatment outcomes for depression suggest that even after the completion of therapy, 54% of individuals relapse within two years following treatment [@vittenglReducingRelapseRecurrence2007]. 
Depression is currently a highly intractable disorder with a high rate of recurrence and relapse. 
Translational research that strives to develop a better understanding of factors that contribute to ongoing symptoms and relapse is urgently needed to develop effective treatments. 
The present study sought to examine the effectiveness of an online/smartphone app based intervention (Headspace) in mitigating depression symptoms and modifying emotion reactivity as indexed by neural activity and self-report ratings.

### Emotion reactivity in depression

Impaired emotion reactivity and regulation are characteristic of MDD [e.g., @joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a; @rottenbergMoodEmotionMajor2005]. 
Emotion reactivity refers to an individual’s initial baseline affective response to a stimulus and is marked by alterations in a number of response systems, such as perception, expressive behavior, feeling, and physiology [@ekmanArgumentBasicEmotions1992; @keltnerFunctionalAccountsEmotions1999].
Reactivity can vary in terms of arousal (not arousing to very arousing) and valence [negative to positive; @grossEmotionEmotionRegulation2014], which is consistent with Russell’s [-@russellCircumplexModelAffect1980] circumplex framework. 
Emotion regulation refers to psychological processes that influence an initial emotional response [@lewisAdvancesProblemsChallenges2010a] and suggests a change from baseline reactivity.
Although it may seem intuitive to define reactivity and regulation in terms of chronometry, it is unclear when reactivity ends and regulation begins. 
Further, there is often (at least) partial overlap between the two processes [@davidsonReactivityRecoveryRegulation2018], making it difficult to disentangle the two, which is supported by previous work in our lab (Kahrilas et al., in prep).
A possible defining characteristic between reactivity and regulation is whether the motivational significance of an emotional stimulus is being altered [@hajcakSignificanceSignificanceEmpirical2020; @kahrilasNeurobiologicalCorrelatesEmotioninpreparation].

There are three predominant views of emotion reactivity in depression: negative potentiation, positive attenuation, and emotion context insensitivity (ECI). 
The negative potentiation view states that negative mood [i.e., diffuse and slow-moving feeling states with weaker ties to specific events and stimuli in one’s environment; @watsonMoodTemperament2000] in MDD is due to potentiated emotional reactivity in response to negative emotional stimuli. 
Positive attenuation holds that those with MDD will have reduced emotional reactivity in response to positive stimuli [@rottenbergMoodEmotionMajor2005]. 
The negative and positive attenuation views are not mutually exclusive, and those with MDD can theoretically display attenuation to positive and negative stimuli  concomitantly. 
The ECI theory maintains that MDD is marked by a pattern of reduced reactivity to both positive and negative stimuli [@rottenbergMoodEmotionMajor2005]. 
While the ECI theory is compatible with the positive attenuation theory, it hypothesizes attenuated reactivity in response to negative stimuli as well, which is at odds with the negative potentiation theory.

Bylsma and colleagues [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008a] conducted a meta-analysis examining the evidence for each of these three theories of emotional reactivity in MDD. 
Studies used in the meta-analysis contained participants with a diagnosis of current MDD using DSM criteria, a reference (i.e., healthy control) group, and measures of emotional reactivity that included self-report, expressive behavioral, or peripheral physiological measures/indicators [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008a]. 
Results illustrated that MDD was associated with consistent reductions in positive emotion reactivity and negative emotion reactivity (i.e., the ECI theory), and that effect sizes were greater for reductions in positive emotional reactivity than negative emotional reactivity [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008a].
More research is needed to reconcile these findings with research that has found support for the negative potentiation theory [@chanHighlyNeuroticNeverdepressed2007; @ellisDysphoriaBeingRed2010], though results support that positive attenuation is a robust feature of depression. 
Despite some inconsistent findings regarding negative emotion reactivity in depression, a plurality of research utilizing self-report and physiological methods to measure emotion reactivity support the ECI view [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008a], or that there is attenuated emotion reactivity in response to positive *and* negative stimuli.

It should be noted that research utilizing ecological momentary assessment methods have found results in the opposite direction than those derived in laboratory assessments, or that individuals with MDD exhibit a “brightening effect” with greater reactivity to positive events [@khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019].
One explanation for these findings is that those with depression harbor more negative expectations for future events [@khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019].
These lower expectations, then, amplify responses to positive stimuli [@mcnamaraAdaptiveResponseUncertainty2013]. 
It is unclear why laboratory settings have failed to replicate a "brightening effect," though it is possible that standardized stimuli are less salient that real day-to-day experiences [@khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019].
Given the laboratory context of the present study, our hypotheses were ultimately informed from other laboratory studies. 
Therefore, we hypothesized that attenuated reactivity to positive and negative stimuli would be associated with increased depression symptoms.

### Positive Affectivity and Depression

The emotion reactivity MDD literature discussed thus far has generally illustrated attenuated reactivity in response to positive stimuli (i.e., the positive attenuation view). 
This is supported by a hallmark symptom of MDD, anhedonia [@americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2013b].
Anhedonia negatively impacts daily function, predicts poor treatment response, indicates risk for future depressive episodes, and shows specificity with regard to depression diagnosis [@khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019; @watsonSpecificityPositiveEmotional2010b].
It is theorized that anhedonia involves abnormal bi-directional reactivity and regulatory affective processes including 1) positive attenuation, or hyporeactivity to positive stimuli [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008a; @forbesNeuralSystemsPositive2005] and 2) impaired capacity to enhance or upregulate affective responses evoked by positive stimuli [@forbesNeuralSystemsPositive2005].
Moving forward, a new focus on developing evidence-based strategies to target impairments in the experience of positive emotions in depression could be critical to improving the low treatment outcome rate in depression [@kahrilasSavoringMomentLink2020; @siltonRegulatingPositiveEmotions2020b].

Affective theories of mood and anxiety disorders that have postulated low positive affectivity (PA) to be a specific risk factor for depression [@clarkTripartiteModelAnxiety1991; @kendallProspectiveAssociationsLow2015; @lewinsohnPleasantActivitiesDepression1973; @raesDampeningPositiveAffect2012; @watsonTestingTripartiteModel1995; @watsonTestingTripartiteModel1995a] and catalyst for exacerbated depressive symptomatology [@clarkTripartiteModelAnxiety1991; @davidsonAffectiveStyleAffective1998; @kahrilasSavoringMomentLink2020; @watsonExtraversionPsychopathologyFacetlevel2015].
PA reflects one’s disposition to experience intense and frequent episodes of pleasant moods [@watsonPositiveAffectivity2009], such as happiness, interest, energy, and self-assurance [@minekaComorbidityAnxietyUnipolar1998; @watsonSpecificityPositiveEmotional2010b] as well as level of pleasurable engagement with one’s environment and ability to respond to positive events [@watsonPositiveAffectivity2009; @watsonPositiveNegativeAffectivity1988; @watsonSpecificityPositiveEmotional2010b].
PA pertains to one's reactivity to positive emotions and experiences, or disposition to recognize, attend to, and ultimately experience positive emotions [e.g., happiness, interest, energy, and self-assurance; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009].
On the other hand, high negative affectivity (NA) may be a global indicator of distress in depression and anxiety disorders [@watsonNegativeAffectivityDisposition1984].  

Mainstream treatments for depression, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors; @priceNeurocircuitryMoodDisorders2010a] predominantly focus on ameliorating distorted thought patterns and neurotransmitter systems pertaining to negative emotions [@argyropoulosAnhedoniaRevisitedThere2013; @beckCognitiveTherapyEmotional1979; @dunnChangesPositiveNegative2019]. 
Dunn et al. [-@dunnHelpingDepressedClients2012; -@dunnOpportunitiesChallengesEmerging2017a] conducted two studies investigating the efficacy of therapeutic and pharmacological approaches to treating depression.
Findings showed that high NA and low PA were both important targets in treating depression, and that treatments aimed at enhancing the experience of positive emotions (i.e., enhancing reactivity to positive events/stimuli) in depression may improve efficacy.
Thus, we aimed to examine relations among PA and emotion reactivity in the present study.

### Neural Correlates of Emotion Reactivity in Depression

Research investigating neural correlates of emotional reactivity to affective stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in those without mood disorders indicates enhanced activity predominantly in the right occipital cortex [i.e., fusiform cortex, lateral occipital cortex, and medial parietal cortex; @bradleyActivationVisualCortex2003], as well as amygdala and visual cortex [@sabatinelliParallelAmygdalaInferotemporal2005] in response to arousing affective (pleasant and unpleasant) images compared to neutral images. The largest changes in brain activity are observed for highly arousing stimuli, such as mutilations, erotica, and threat, compared to neutral objects [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007].
Attenuated ventral striatum (a structure linked with processing of rewarding/positive stimuli) activity has been observed in response to positive visual stimuli in individuals with MDD [@epsteinLackVentralStriatal2006; @lawrenceSubcorticalVentralPrefrontal2004; @surguladzeDifferentialPatternNeural2005], which is further correlated with participant’s self-reported lack of interest and pleasure in activities, suggesting that hypoactivation of this structure is reflective of anhedonia [i.e., lack of pleasures; @epsteinLackVentralStriatal2006].
Other studies have found enhanced activity in frontal brain structures involved in emotion regulation (middle frontal gyrus, cingulate cortex, dorsolateral PFC) during emotion reactivity to positive stimuli in those with MDD [@demenescuNeuralCorrelatesPerception2011; @ochsnerBottomUpTopDownProcesses2009].
This pattern of findings may index increased attention orientation and processing demands to mood-incongruent stimuli [@demenescuNeuralCorrelatesPerception2011]. 
Regarding negative emotion reactivity, studies have indicated increased responsiveness to, and memory for, negative stimuli as illustrated by enhanced amygdala response to negative emotional stimuli [@falesAlteredEmotionalInterference2008; @savitzImagingPhenotypesMajor2009] in those with MDD compared to controls. 

While the aforementioned research has illustrated differences in emotion reactivity between clinical and non-clinical samples, other studies have found no differences [@almeidaElevatedAmygdalaActivity2010; @demenescuNeuralCorrelatesPerception2011; @diekhofFunctionalNeuroimagingReward2008; @gotlibSubgenualAnteriorCingulate2005; @norburyIncreasedNeuralResponse2010; @siegleCanShakeThat2002]. 
Possible explanations for mixed findings regarding positive and negative emotional reactivity include depression severity, medication status, and differing levels of co-occurring anxiety dimensions.
Increased amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli has been observed in those with severe depression [@shelineIncreasedAmygdalaResponse2001], and medication may be linked to down-regulation of amygdala response [@fuAttenuationNeuralResponse2004; @lawrenceSubcorticalVentralPrefrontal2004; @shelineIncreasedAmygdalaResponse2001].
In contrast, participants with mild-to-moderate depression severity (with and without medication) do not exhibit differences in amygdala activity  in emotion reactivity compared to controls [@demenescuNeuralCorrelatesPerception2011].
Accounting for co-occurring dimensions of anxiety can help clarify distinct patterns of emotion reactivity and neural activity associated with PA [@sharpTransdiagnosticDimensionsAnxiety2015].
Neuroscience research investigating depression that does not account for comorbid anxious apprehension and anxious arousal can yield mixed findings [@herringtonLocalizationAsymmetricBrain2010; @sharpTransdiagnosticDimensionsAnxiety2015].
Further, [-@engelsCooccurringAnxietyInfluences2010] found evidence for interactions among anxious arousal and apprehension with anhedonic depression.
Anxious apprehension can be defined as a tendency to engage in negative, ruminative thinking, and is analogous to enduring state worry [@burdwoodRestingstateFunctionalConnectivity2016; @ruscioTaxometricInvestigationLatent2001], while anxious arousal can entail hypervigilance and sympathetic nervous system hyperarousal to mild stressors [@nitschkeContrastingPatternsBrain1999].
Altogether, this necessitates a dimensional approach to measuring depression symptoms in the context of neural emotional reactivity, as different patterns of neural activity may accompany varying degrees of illness severity and anxiety comorbidity. 
Additionally, we included measures of anxious arousal and anxious apprehension in subsequent analyses in order to more adequately investigate relations among low PA and emotion reactivity.

### Measuring the Temporal Course of Emotion Reactivity in Depression: Event-Related Potentials Index Dynamic Cascade of Processes

Emotion reactivity is enabled by a rapid processing pathway that recruits thalamus and amygdala [@ledouxEmotionCircuitsBrain2000], and research has suggested neural responses as early as 100 ms that are contingent upon modifiable individual differences [e.g., empathy; @stockdaleCoolCallousControl2017].
Electroencephalography (EEG) allows for the analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) that facilitate assessment of neural responses to affective stimuli with millisecond temporal resolution [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
A better understanding of the temporal course of ERPs evoked by affective stimuli will advance knowledge regarding the dynamic cascade of processes contributing to emotion reactivity in those with depression and how these processes can be modified.

Affective disorders such as MDD and dysthymia are associated with abnormal emotional reactivity as indexed by the late positive potential (LPP) in response to affective stimuli [@grunewaldAttenuatedLPPEmotional2019]. 
LPP is a sustained positive slow wave EEG component observed starting as early as 300 ms following stimuli onset and is as an established index of evaluative congruency, valence, and arousal in response to visual stimuli [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008]. 
LPP over the centroparietal cortex is augmented in the presence of unpleasant and pleasant compared to neutral images [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @dillonDissociationEventrelatedPotentials2006; @fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @hajcakTemporalDynamicsEmotion2007; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003] and is most pronounced for images that are rated as highly arousing [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007]. 
LPP has been theorized to reflect activation of a brain network engaged in processing affective visual stimuli, including subcortical structures, particularly the amygdala [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003]. 

Attenuated LPP in response to both unpleasant and pleasant affective stimuli as been observed in those with MDD [@fotiReducedElectrocorticalResponse2010; @kayserEventrelatedPotentialsERPs2000; @macnamaraDiagnosticSymptombasedPredictors2016], which is consistent with the ECI view of emotion reactivity in depression [@rottenbergEmotionContextInsensitivity2005].
A study conducted by Weinberg and colleagues [-@weinbergDepressionReducedNeural2016] found that, in a sample with diagnoses of MDD and anxiety disorders, a diagnosis of MDD was uniquely associated with attenuated LPP in response to rewarding visual stimuli while a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder was not. 
The aforementioned study did not demonstrate an association with MDD diagnosis and reduced LPP in response to threatening stimuli [@weinbergDepressionReducedNeural2016], thus ultimately showing support for the positive attenuation view of emotion reactivity.
A follow up study found that those with MDD and previous suicide attempts (an index for illness severity) had blunted LPP in response to threatening stimuli compared to those with MDD and without a history of suicide attempts [@weinbergDecreasedNeuralResponse2017].
This effect was unique to threatening (not rewarding) images, which is consistent with fMRI accounts of depression severity altering amygdala activity patterns in response to negative stimuli [@demenescuNeuralCorrelatesPerception2011].
Overall, this suggests difference in neural reactivity depending on illness severity and further underscores the need for dimensional measures of psychopathology rather than a categorical nosology.
Lending additional support to the ECI view are findings that illustrate negative associations among LPP elicited in response to positive and negative images and depression symptoms [@hillAbnormalEmotionalReactivity2019]. 
Of note in the Hill et al. (2019) study was the use of structural equation modeling (SEM).
In contrast to more ubiquitous OLS regression methods, SEM allows the researcher to explicitly model measurement error, assess overall model fit, and statistically compare competing models.
Thus, Hill and colleagues constructed two separate factors: a neural reactivity and internalizing model.
The former was created by estimating covariances among LPP in response to neutral, positive, and negative images and the latter among the depression, anxiety, and stress subscales of the DASS-21.
This allowed the researchers to then estimate covariances among the variances unique to each manifest, or observed, variable while controlling for the shared variance among each of the other indicator variables.
For example, this technique allows the user to estimate relations between the unique variances of each each viewing condition and specific facets of psychopathology.
Not only does this method afford more flexibility and ability to test more intricate theories, it is also more reliable than calculating difference scores (e.g., difference in LPP elicited between positive and neutral images) and allows to examine variance that is unique to a given condition [@cronbachHowWeShould1970; @weinbergHeritabilityNeuralResponse2015].
By comparing Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria, Hill et al. found that the model corresponding to the ECI view provided the best fit to the data.
Additionally, parameter estimates that approached significance (*p* = .05) were found by estimating covariances among LPP in response to positive/negative images and depression symptoms [@hillAbnormalEmotionalReactivity2019].
A notable omission in the aforementioned study were likelihood ratio tests between the nested comparison and baseline models.
This information would inform the reader as to whether various statistical models actually fit the data better that the initial measurement model that treated the neural reactivity and internalizing factors as entirely orthogonal constructs.
Further, the depression subscale of the DASS-21 gives emphasis to anhedonia, hopelessness, and devaluation of life, and is thus not specific to low PA [@lovibondManualDepressionAnxiety1996].
Measuring relations among neural activity and specific facets of depression are important considerations given the heterogeneity inherent in depression [@monroeDepressionShroudHeterogeneity2015].
Indeed, more granular assessments of psychopathology will afford more targeted interventions and refined theories of how self report data relate to neurobiological constructs.
Related, Weinberg and colleagues [-@weinbergDistinctAssociationsLow2018] found blunted LPP in response to rewarding and threatening images in those endorsing lower levels of PA, a pattern of results ultimately lending support to the ECI view.
Thus, we hypothesized that PA would be uniquely and negatively associated with LPP amplitude in response to positive and negative stimuli.

Research conducted by our lab and others have identified early visual ERP components that are sensitive to reactivity to emotional stimuli [i.e., N170 & EPN; @frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019; @kahrilasNeurobiologicalCorrelatesEmotioninpreparation].
Studies investigating whether these ERP components are modified in depression have produced mixed findings.
Research from Foti and colleagues [-@fotiReducedElectrocorticalResponse2010] illustrated that early ERP components are unmodified in individuals with MDD compared to individuals without MDD (as indexed by enhanced vertex parietal potential, a component theorized to reflect perceptual processing and encoding of facial stimuli, in response to fearful/angry compared to neutral faces). 
In contrast, Dai and Feng [-@daiMoreExcitedNegative2012] found smaller N170 amplitudes in response to happy faces in sub-clinical MDD cases and enhanced N170 in response to negative faces in clinical MDD cases, which is congruent with the positive attenuation and negative potentiation views. 
Chen and colleagues [-@chenDistinctFacialProcessing2014] noted lower N170 amplitude in response to happy, neutral, and sad faces in a visual emotions oddball paradigm using face stimuli for those with a first episode of major depression. 
The same study indicated that those with recurrent depression exhibited enhanced N170 amplitude in response to sad faces and attenuated N170 amplitude in response to happy and neutral faces [@chenDistinctFacialProcessing2014], demonstrating patterns of emotion reactivity that vary as a function of illness history.
Research investigating N170/EPN and emotional reactivity in response to complex affective images (e.g., International Affective Pictures System, or IAPS) in depression is scant, with one study finding enhanced EPN activation in response to negative compared to neutral images for individuals with depression among binge drinkers [@connellBingeDrinkingDepression2015].
Following these findings, I hypothesized that PA would be associated with attenuated N170 and EPN amplitude in response to passively viewing positive stimuli compared to neutral stimuli.
Given the equivocal findings regarding these early components in response to negative images, analyses regarding the relationship between PA and N170/EPN in response to passively viewing negative compared to neutral stimuli were conducted in an exploratory manner.

Most of the aforementioned research utilizes windowed averages, or area measures, for measuring ERP components.
However, this method is inadequate in dealing with the thorny issue of overlapping components [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978].
Indeed, there is speculation that N170 modulation due to emotional expressions may be due to superimposed EPN activity [@relleckeEmotionEffectsN1702013].
Similarly, LPP may overlap with P3, a parietally maximal component peaking in the 300-400 ms window that is sensitive to task relevant and motivationally significant stimuli [@polichCognitiveBiologicalDeterminants1995], and even later portions of EPN [@schuppSelectiveProcessingBriefly2004].
To address this issue, we utilized an exploratory temporal principal components analysis (PCA) to better isolate distinct ERP components across time.
PCA is a dimension reduction technique that identifies a new set of variables that are linear combinations of the original variables.
In the context of ERPs, these new variables represent latent components that may not be apparent by visually inspecting ERP averages.
For example, if there were two temporally overlapping ERP components with equal magnitude but opposite directionality (positive and negative), the two components would negate each other and not be observable via inspection of grand average ERPs.
Temporal PCA, on the other hand, would theoretically be able to retain these components provided that the experimental paradigm reliably produces them.

Thus, the present study aimed to contributed to the literature in several ways while building upon the SEM framework in Hill et al. (2019).
Rather than analyzing associations with later components, analyses will be expanded to incorporate other early visual components to determine their relations with internalizing symptoms.
Next, rather than using windowed averages for scoring ERP components, we utilized PCA identify ERP components of interest to submit to statistical analyses.
Further, the present study will examine unique relations among ERP components and PA while controlling for dimensions of anxiety.
<!-- Last, in addition to comparing AIC and BIC among models with equal degrees of freedom, we also conducted chi-square likelihood ratio tests to determine if competing models afforded superior data fit when compared to nested comparison (i.e., measurement) models. -->

<!-- #### Savoring and mindfulness.  -->

<!-- Savoring-based regulatory strategies are used to sustain and upregulate positive emotions [@heiyBackBasicsNaturalistic2014; @liuSelectionImplementationEmotion2017]. -->
<!-- While savoring, one may eagerly anticipate future positive experiences, focus on ongoing positive experiences as they occur in the present moment, or reminisce about past positive experiences. -->
<!-- With specific relevance to depression, studies aimed at enhancing savoring capacity show that enriching any of the three temporal domains of savoring (reminiscing, savoring the moment, or anticipating) is associated with increased frequency and intensity of positive affect, and decreased negative affect [@bryantDimensionsSubjectiveMental1984; @bryantSavoringNewModel2007; @kahrilasSavoringMomentLink2020]. -->
<!-- Training on momentary positive emotion regulation (i.e., memory building, expressing positive emotions) resulted in decreased self-reported depression symptoms when compared to a control group after two weeks [@hurleyResultsStudyIncrease2012]. -->
<!-- Intervention studies with older adults have shown that savoring was positively related to decreased depression, increased activity engagement, and increased wellbeing [@smithEffectsSavoringIntervention2017; @smithImpactSavoringAbility2020]. -->
<!-- Savoring may improve the capacity to recognize and enjoy positive moments, even during difficult times [@smithEffectsSavoringIntervention2017]. -->
<!-- Positive self-attributions for recent positive events have been associated with attenuated depression symptoms and enhanced positive affect following positive events in a sample of college-aged women [@mcmakinPositiveAffectStimulation2011].  -->

<!-- While savoring and mindfulness are not analogous, there may be some overlapping conceptual aspects [@bryantAppreciatingLifeMidst2015; @bryantSavoringNewModel2007; @hurleyResultsStudyIncrease2012]. -->
<!-- Increased attention to positive stimuli is a candidate psychological mechanism through which positive emotion regulation strategies are theorized to mitigate depression symptoms [@carlPositiveEmotionRegulation2013; @joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a]. -->
<!-- Mindfulness meditation practices and mindfulness-based interventions emphasize the importance of cultivating non-judgmental attention and awareness in the present moment [@guHowMindfulnessbasedCognitive2015a], which may broaden one’s cognitive scope and help enhance savoring capacity [@garlandMindfulnessBroadensAwareness2015a]. -->
<!-- Thus, I hypothesized that savoring capacity would be negatively related to depression, and that those undergoing an MBI will report increases in savoring capacity. -->

## The Present Study

The present study utilized a sample from an earlier experiment (Kahrilas et al., in prep) where participants were not recruited on the basis of depression severity, and the Supported Mindful Learning (SMiLe) study, a three-month randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of Headspace in mitigating psychological symptoms in a sample of college students with depression.
Participants that met inclusion criteria in the SMILE study were randomized to one of three experimental groups, two of which included self-guided Headspace use and another that served as an experimental control (i.e., wait list).
Participants also completed batteries of surveys at four separate time points. 

At two time points (before orientation and two months later), participants also underwent an experimental paradigm consisting of seven blocks of images using 120 different Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS) stimuli.
Forty images were highly arousing positive images, 40 images were highly arousing negative images, and 40 were neutral.
Participants were tasked with increasing or decreasing emotional intensity in response to (i.e., upregulating or downregulating) positive and negative images, as well as passively watching them.
Participants also passively viewed the block of 40 neutral images.
EEG was recorded during the experimental paradigm.
Following each block of images, participants were asked to rate on a seven-point scale how positive or negative they feel (valence), the intensity of the emotion they feel (arousal), as well as how difficult the regulation task was (difficulty).
Only the passive viewing conditions (positive, negative, and neutral) were analyzed for the present study.
The data from time one of the SMiLe study was harmonized with the data from Kahrilas et al. to afford greater variability in variables of interest (e.g., PA), which will afford more dimensionality in statistical analyses.

Overall, the primary objective of the present study was to evaluate several statistical models characterizing patterns of emotion reactivity (as indexed by N170, EPN, and LPP, derived with PCA) with PA (while accounting for anxious arousal and anxious apprehension) within an SEM framework.
We hypothesized that there would be negative associations between LPP reactivity in response to positive/negative images and PA, and that this model would afford superior fit compared to competing models.
Regarding earlier visual components (N170, EPN), we hypothesized that emotion reactivity in response to positive images would be negatively associated with PA.
No hypotheses were made regarding early visual component activity in response to negative images and its relation to PA, and these analyses were carried out in an exploratory manner.

## METHOD
### SMiLe Study

The Supported Mindful Learning (SMiLe) study is a three-month randomized controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of Headspace in reducing psychological symptoms in a sample of college students with depression. 
Participants that met inclusion criteria were randomized to one of three experimental groups and completed batteries of surveys at four separate timepoints. 
Approximately 15 students per fall and spring semester were recruited over the course of three years (Fall 2017 - Spring 2020) for a total of six semesters. 
As noted earlier, only pre-trial baseline data was used fro the present study.
Eighty undergraduate students were recruited from a mid-sized, Midwestern university for the SMiLe study.
Participants were recruited using listserv emails, flyers, and Sona postings.
Additionally, a sample ($N$ = 52) of undergraduate students used for a different study in our lab (Kahrilas et al., in preparation) that were not selected on the basis of depression symptoms were harmonized with the present sample at pre-trial baseline (total $N$ = 134) for the present study.

### Participants
Of the 80 participants recruited for the SMiLe study, 72 underwent the EEG paradigm, and nine we excluded due to messy EEG data.
One participant was dropped from the study following their EEG session, and thus was not included in final analyses.
This resulted in a final total of 62 from the SMiLe study.
These 62 participants were pooled with the sample of 52 from Kahrilas et al. (in preparation) for a total $n$ of 114.
In this harmonized sample, participants were 18 to 29 years old ($M$ = 19.4, $SD$ = 1.64), 75% of which identified as female, 21% as male, 0.9% as transgender, 0.9% as non-binary, and 1.7% as other.
Seventy-one percent identified as heterosexual, 21% as bisexual, 4% as gay, and 4% as a different sexual orientation.
Sixty-nine percent of participants identified as Caucasian, 15% Asian, 8% Hispanic or Latinx, 5% Multi-Racial, 1% as Black, and 1% as Other.

### Materials and Procedure
#### Inclusion Criteria

To determine eligibility for the SMiLe study, interested participants completed an online screening survey through Opinio.
Inclusion criteria included the following: participants had to be an undergraduate at the institution from which the study was being conducted, at least 18 years old, and endorse clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms as indicated by a score of greater than 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8, Kroenke & Spitzer, 2002; Kroenke et al., 2009).
For screening purposes, an eight-item version of the PHQ-9 was utilized with the suicidality item omitted (per IRB request).
Individuals were excluded if they had a history of neurological conditions or head trauma, regular practice of mindfulness in the past six months [which is in line with exclusion criteria used in previous research; e.g., @vandamMindHypeCritical2018], prior use of the Headspace app within the past six months, and unwillingness to join the peer support group (if randomized to the Headspace with Peer Support group).

#### Questionnaire Measures 

To evaluate depression severity, the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9; @kroenkePHQ9ValidityBrief2001]was administered.
PHQ-9 items are scored from “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day) and are based on the depression criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. 
Internal consistency of the PHQ-9 in the present study was good ($\omega = .82$).

To assess for positive affectivity and anxious arousal, the 39-item Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (Watson, Clark, et al., 1995; Watson, Weber, et al., 1995) was administered. 
The 14-item positive affectivity (PA) Scale (MASQ-PA14; e.g., “Felt cheerful”) and the 17-item Anxious Arousal Scale (MASQ-AA; e.g., “Startled easily”) were used for subsequent analyses.
Previous literature has supported these oblique factors in two independent samples of individuals at-risk for depression and anxiety (Kahrilas et al., 2020; Kendall et al., 2015; Nitschke et al., 2001).
Participants rated their affectivity and anxiety symptoms using a five-point Likert scale from “1” (not at all) to “5” (extremely).
Consistent with previous research [@bredemeierScreeningDepressiveDisorders2010] the MASQ scales demonstrated good to excellent internal consistency (MASQ-PA14, $\omega = .95$ and MASQ-AA, $\omega = .85$).

To measure anxious apprehension, the 16-item Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer et al., 1990) was administered. 
PSWQ items are rated on a five-point Likert scale from “1” (not at all typical) to “5” (very typical). 
Meyer and colleagues (1990) found a high degree of internal consistency in the PSWQ, and the present study found excellent consistency ($\omega = 0.94$).

#### Emotion task paradigm

64-channel high-density electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded while participants viewed seven blocks of 40 images (280 total trials).
The study used 120 different Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS) images [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
40 of the images were positive, 40 were neutral, and 40 were negative.
Previous research has shown that 40 trials is sufficient to evoke a reliable LPP component [@fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
The mean normative valence ratings (on a scale of one to seven) were 5.71, 4.09, and 2.18 for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.
The mean normative arousal ratings (on a scale of one to seven) were 4.46, 1.99, and 4.52, for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.

Each block represented an experimental regulation condition: increase (positive/negative), decrease (positive/negative), and watch (positive/negative/neutral).
During the increase condition, participants were instructed to appraise the picture in a way that will intensify the emotion that is elicited by looking at it.
During the decrease condition, participants were asked to reduce the intensity of the emotion that is elicited by looking at the picture.
When prompted to watch, participants were asked to view the picture as they would naturally.
The passive “watch” blocks served as baseline conditions for LPP component analyses [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
A block design was selected for the proposed study because valenced images outnumber the neutral images two-to-one.
The relatively rare neutral stimuli may produce a P3 if intermixed with valenced stimuli in the same block [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000]. Additionally, LPP signal is increased for stimuli that are perceived as incongruent within a given affective context.
Thus, a neutral stimulus displayed in a series of emotional stimuli would likely evoke an enhanced LPP activity, thus decreasing effect size [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000].
Further, a block design paradigm may better emulate one's natural environment, as stimuli of congruent valence are typically encountered in clusters rather than isolation [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].
Research comparing intermixed and block designs for LPP and EPN have shown comparable findings between the two approaches [@pastorAffectivePicturePerception2008; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].

First, participants completed three practice trials that consisted of 10 images not used during the actual task [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
Participants were instructed to increase or decrease emotional arousal in response to a mixture of positive and negative images, respectively.
Participants were also asked to watch a third practice trial comprised of positive, negative, and neutral images.
Stimuli were presented in random order within each block.
Prior to each practice trial, participants were provided with instructions on how to regulate (increase/decrease) their affective response to the stimuli, or to simply view the stimuli [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
Participants were shown which regulation strategy to engage in (increase, decrease, or watch) at the start of each experimental block.
Once the participant was ready, an OASIS stimulus appeared for 2000 ms [@fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008].
Following stimulus offset, a blank screen appeared for 500 ms followed by a fixation cross for 1500 ms (± 250 ms) for a total ISI of 1750 - 2250 ms (see Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image-2) for a visual depiction of the experimental paradigm used in the present study).
This interval is identical to other studies utilizing the IAPS and investigating LPP [@dunningSeeNoEvil2009; @hajcakMotivatedControlledAttention2009].
Stimuli within each block were presented in random order.
Each block was separated by a break and presented in pseudo-random order, such that no valence (i.e., positive or negative) nor regulation (i.e., increase, decrease, or watch) condition were presented consecutively.
After each experimental block, valence and arousal ratings were collected using a seven-point likert scale and the same instructions used in Kurdi, Lozano, and Banaji’s [-@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] norming study of the OASIS stimuli set.
Furthermore, difficulty ratings on a seven-point likert scale were also obtained.

### Apparatus and Physiological Recording
Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) was measured while participants completed an emotion regulation task (Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image-2)).
Participants were seated in a comfortable chair, approximately 24 inches from a 24-inch LCD monitor in a quiet, dimly lit room.
Participants were monitored by a task administrator in a nearby room and received task instructions by intercom.
EEG data were recorded using a Biosemi Active2 EEG system.
A custom-designed Falk Minow 64-channel cap with equidistantly spaced BioSemi active Ag and AgCl electrodes was used for data collection.
CMS/DRL was placed near the vertex, and two electrodes were located on the mastoid bones.
After placement of the electrode cap, electrode positions were digitized.
An additional electrode was placed on the inferior edge of the orbit of each eye to monitor vertical eye movements; nearby electrodes in the cap (lateral to each eye) monitored horizontal eye movements.
Data were recorded with a band pass of 0 – 104 Hz at a sampling rate of 512 Hz.

The following EEG data processing steps were implemented in Brain Electrical Source Analysis software [BESA, Version 7; @schergBESABrainElectric1990].
Following the adaptive artifact correction method [@illeArtifactCorrectionOngoing2002], ocular artifacts were corrected using a spatial PCA filter.
EEG data were re-referenced to the [@hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006]  average reference of all electrodes for analyses and digitally filtered with 0.01 Hz high-pass and 30 Hz low-pass filters with a cutoff attenuation of 12 dB/octave.
EEG data were re-referenced to the average activity of all electrodes.
While it is convention to re-reference data to average activity of the mastoids for LPP, a covariance matrix was utilized in the PCA, which is inherently mean corrected [@dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012].
Thus, minimal effects would be expected as a function of referencing scheme for temporal PCA (though this is not the case for spatial PCA; see @dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012).
Muscle activity and other artifacts were corrected through implementing an algorithmic scan of continuous EEG data in BESA (fixed threshold criteria: amplitude > 120 uV; gradient > 75 uV, low signal <.01 uV).
Data were baseline-adjusted by subtracting the average activity for 200 milliseconds [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] before stimulus onset.

### Temporal PCA
To discriminate among temporal sources of variance (i.e., ERP components) in the time course of ERPs, ERP averages were submitted to a temporal PCA to derive linear combinations of data that distinguish activity across time points. 
A temporal PCA was performed using the Psych package [@revellePsychProceduresPsychological2020] in R version 4.0.3 [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2020] with a covariance matrix.
A covariance matrix was used to retain the original units of measurement (i.e., voltage) for the average ERPs for each time point [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978].
The temporal PCA used all time points (-200 ms - 2000 ms) as variables and all 114 participants, three blocks, and 64 recording sites as observations, yielding linear combinations of time points and "temporal" factors [@dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012].
To determine the number of components to retain for rotation, a parallel analysis [@hornRationaleTestNumber1965] was performed on the resultant Scree plot.
The parallel analysis creates Scree plots of the actual and simulated fully random data to determine the number of components that explain more variance than if only chance alone were acting. 
Based on the parallel analysis, 22 components were retained for rotation. 
An Promax rotation was then used on the 22 components because it does not impose orthogonality, and simulation studies suggest that Promax is most effective for temporal PCA [@dienERPPCAToolkit2010; @dienEvaluationPCAICA2007].
The time course of each of the 22 components was inspected by plotting the covariance loadings along each time point. 
To further guide our selection of components, we used a previous study conducted by our lab (Kahrilas et al., in prep) that analyzed the time course of emotion reactivity and regulation using PCA.
PCA components with covariance loadings in time windows that fit descriptions of LPP and early visual components (e.g., N170, EPN) that matched components sensitive to emotion reactivity in Kahrilas et al. (in prep) were retained for statistical analyses.
Spatial information is retained in PCA; the topography of each factor is encoded in the mean amplitude of factor scores at each recording site [@dienAddressingMisallocationVariance1998].
Thus, scalp topographies of each component for each condition was inspected to determine correspondence of components and ERP components of interest.
Of note, portions of waveforms represented by a given PCA component can be reproduced by multiplying covariance loadings by observations' factor scores [@dienAddressingMisallocationVariance1998]. 
Three components were retained for statistical analyses based inspection of topographic plots and ERP waveforms.
Two of the retained components represented LPP-like components that have positive peaks at 371 ms and 736 ms with the former demonstrating activity at PO7 and PO8 electrode sites and the latter at PO7, PO8, PO3, PO4, P1, P2, P5/P3, P6/P4 and Pz electrode sites. 
Similar to findings from Kahrilas et al. (in preparation), topography of a 257 ms component indicated two distinct sources of activity: positive going waveforms in the occipital region (PO7, PO8, O1, and O2) and negative waveforms in the centroparietal region (CPz and Pz).
Each of these sites were scored separately and submitted to statistical analyses.
No component resembling an N170 was derived from the PCA.

All visualizations were composed using the ggplot (Wickham, 2016) and eegUtils (Craddock, 2019) packages.

### Analytical approach

Descriptive statistics were calculated using R version 4.0.3 [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2020]. 
SEM was conducted using the lavaan package [@rosseelLavaanPackageStructural2012].
Further, the first author made extensive use of the dplyr (Wickham et al., 2021) package in data cleaning and manipulation.
Our modeling process largely followed that of Hill et al. (2019).
Our first stage of modeling was to construct a measurement model with two latent orthogonal factors.
Neutral, negative, and positive viewing conditions served as indicator variables of the *Neural Reactivity* factor.
Measures of anxious apprehension (PSWQ), anxious arousal (MASQ-AA), and PA (MASQ-PA) served as indicator variables for the *Internalizing* factor.
Four separate measurement models were constructed for each ERP component retained from the earlier PCA.
Across these measurement models, indicators of the *Neural Reactivity* factor changed to reflect each PCA component being tested, while the *Internalizing* factor remained the same.
Thus, while loadings of he indicators for the *Internalizing* factor remained constained throughout, the overall model fit varied due to different covariance matrices being used across the models.
Across each measurement model, one loading for each latent factor was set to one in order to set a metric for the factors.
All other loadings were freely estimated, as were the variances of each factor and residual variances of each indicator variable.
Each of the subsequent competing models were compared to their respective measurement model with a chi-square likelihood ratio test to determine of each model offered superior fit to the data compared to the measurement model.

We then tested the ECI model by estimating covariances among the positive/negative viewing conditions and PA. 
While Hill and colleagues (2019) constrained these covariances to be equal, we allowed these values to be freely estimated on the basis that the ECI view makes no hypotheses as to whether the *degree* of blunting is equal for positive and negative images, just the negative directionality.
If both estimated covariances were positive (negative for negative peak waveforms) and significant, and if this model offered superior fit to the data compared to the nested comparison measurement model, then we would interpret this as support for the ECI view.
Allowing these covariances to be freely estimated allowed us to determine if the positive attenuation or negative potentiation views offered superior fit, as well.
If a significant positive (negative for negative peak waveforms) covariance between PA and the positive viewing condition was found with no association with the negative viewing condition, this would be evidence for the positive attenuation theory (in the presence of a significant likelihood ratio test compared to the measurement model).
In contrast, if a significant negative (positive for negative peak waveforms) covariance between PA and the negative viewing condition was found in the absence of an association between the positive viewing condition and PA, this would be evidence for the positive attenuation theory (in the presence of a significant likelihood ratio test compared to the measurement model).
Note that the positive attenutation and negative potentiation views are not mutually exclusive, thus these patterns could be observed simultaneously.
Other competing models were directly informed from Hill and colleagues 2019 study.
We tested a neural reactivity model that estimated a covariance between the *Neural Reactivity* latent factor and PA.
This tested whether general neural reactivity to stimuli was associated with PA rather than the residual variances of the positive/negative viewing conditions, specifically.
We then tested an internalizing model that estimated covariances among the positive/negative viewing conditions and the latent *Internalizing* factor, which tested whether emotion reactivity was associated with more general internalizing symptoms rather than PA specifically.
Last, we tested an anxious arousal model that estimated covariances among the positive/negative viewing conditions and the residual variance of the anxious arousal indicator.
This tested the hypothesis of whether reactivity to emotional stimuli was associated with physiological symptoms associated with anxiety specifically.
See Figure XXX for model diagrams of each of the models described.
