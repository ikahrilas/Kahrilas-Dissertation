## CHAPTER FOUR: A POTENTIAL NEURAL MECHANISM SUPPORTING THE BRIGHTENING EFFECT IN DEPRESSION

Impaired emotion reactivity has been observed in individuals with major depressive disorder [MDD; e.g., @joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a; @rottenbergMoodEmotionMajor2005] which is associated with decrements in interpersonal relationships, poor work performance and burnout, and reductions in physical wellbeing [@drussImpairmentRoleFunctioning2009a; @kesslerPrevalenceEffectsMood2006; @lewinsohnPsychosocialFunctioningYoung2003].
Emotion reactivity refers to an individual’s initial baseline affective response to a stimulus, and it is marked by alterations in a number of response systems, such as perception, expressive behavior, feeling, and physiology [@ekmanArgumentBasicEmotions1992; @keltnerFunctionalAccountsEmotions1999].
Consistent with Russell’s [-@russellCircumplexModelAffect1980] affective circumplex framework, reactivity can vary with regard to arousal (not arousing to very arousing) and valence [negative to positive; @grossEmotionEmotionRegulation2014]. 
There are three predominant views of emotion reactivity in depression based on laboratory-based research: negative potentiation, positive attenuation, and emotion context insensitivity (ECI). 
The negative potentiation view states that negative mood [i.e., diffuse and slow-moving feeling states with weaker ties to specific events and stimuli in one’s environment; @watsonMoodTemperament2000] in MDD is due to potentiated emotional reactivity in response to negative emotional stimuli. 
Positive attenuation holds that those with MDD will have reduced emotional reactivity in response to positive stimuli [@rottenbergMoodEmotionMajor2005]. 
The negative potentiation and positive attenuation views are not mutually exclusive; those with MDD can theoretically display both attenuated positive and potentiated negative emotion reactivity. 
The ECI theory maintains that MDD is marked by a pattern of reduced reactivity to both positive and negative stimuli [@rottenbergMoodEmotionMajor2005]. 
While the ECI theory is compatible with the positive attenuation theory, it hypothesizes attenuated reactivity in response to negative stimuli as well, which is at odds with the negative potentiation theory.

Bylsma and colleagues [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008a] conducted a meta-analysis examining the evidence for each of these three theories of emotional reactivity in MDD. 
Studies used in the meta-analysis included participants with a diagnosis of current MDD using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria, a reference group, and measures of emotional reactivity that included self-report, expressive behavioral, or peripheral physiological measures/indicators [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008a]. 
Results illustrated that MDD was consistently associated with consistent reductions in positive emotion reactivity and negative emotion reactivity (i.e., providing support for the ECI theory), and that effect sizes were greater for reductions in positive emotional reactivity than negative emotional reactivity [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008a].
Additional research is needed to reconcile these findings with research that has found support for the negative potentiation theory [@chanHighlyNeuroticNeverdepressed2007; @ellisDysphoriaBeingRed2010], though results support that positive attenuation is a robust feature of depression. 
Despite some inconsistent findings regarding negative emotion reactivity in depression, research using self-report and physiological methods to measure emotion reactivity supports the ECI view [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008a], or that there is attenuated emotion reactivity in response to positive *and* negative stimuli.

Research grounded in daily life experiences using ecological momentary assessment methods have found results in the opposite direction than those derived in laboratory assessments, or that individuals with MDD exhibit a "brightening effect” with greater reactivity to positive events [@khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019].
One potential explanation for these findings is that those with depression harbor more negative expectations for future events [@khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019], and these lower expectations amplify responses to positive stimuli [@mcnamaraAdaptiveResponseUncertainty2013]. 
It is unclear why laboratory settings have failed to replicate a brightening effect, though it is possible that standardized stimuli are less salient than real day-to-day experiences [@khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019].

While four possible frameworks (negative potentiation, positive attenuation, ECI, brightening effect) have been previously discussed in the literature, these frameworks do not fully embrace all eight possible patterns of emotion reactivity that might be observed in individuals with depression (see Figure \@ref(fig:views-of-er)). 
The present study will evaluate all possible patterns of emotion reactivity that might covary with depression symptoms, beyond the four existing frameworks that are included in the literature. 
Given the laboratory context of the present study, our hypotheses were ultimately informed from other laboratory-based studies, which appear to provide the most support for the ECI view. 
Therefore, consistent with the ECI theory, we hypothesized that attenuated reactivity to positive and negative stimuli, as measured via electroencephalography (EEG), would be associated with increased depression symptoms.

The right column illustrates combinations of these possible patterns based on four existing frameworks of emotion reactivity in depression; however, other combinations may also exist, such as concurrent positive attenuation and negative potentiation, concurrent positive and negative potentiation, etc.

```

EEG offers millisecond temporal resolution [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008] that contributes to further refining our understanding of the temporal course of neural correlates implicated in emotion reactivity dysfunction in depression in order to contribute to the development of neuroscience-informed treatments for depression.
Previous research investigating emotion reactivity in depression using EEG has predominately focused on later positive slow wave components that are measured with windowed averages [@hillAbnormalEmotionalReactivity2019; @weinbergDecreasedNeuralResponse2017; @weinbergDepressionReducedNeural2016].
A relatively narrow focus on slow wave components might overlook important neural processes occurring earlier in the time course of emotion reactivity and might be susceptible to measuring overlapping components [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978].
Thus, in the present study we implemented a PCA-approach to measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) in order to identify distinct temporal components, and we also investigated earlier indices of neural activity.  

### Low Positive Affectivity and Emotion Reactivity in Depression

Anhedonia is a hallmark symptom of MDD [American Psychiatric Asssociation -@americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2013b; @treadwayReconsideringAnhedoniaDepression2011].
Anhedonia negatively impacts daily function, predicts poor treatment response, indicates risk for future depressive episodes, and shows specificity with regard to depression diagnosis [@khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019; @watsonSpecificityPositiveEmotional2010b].
While high negative affectivity (NA) may be a global indicator of distress in depression and anxiety disorders [@watsonNegativeAffectivityDisposition1984], low positive affectivity (PA) is a trait that is closely related to anhedonia [@defruytAnhedoniaDepressiveDisorder2020].
Low PA is a catalyst for exacerbated depressive symptomatology [@clarkTripartiteModelAnxiety1991; @davidsonAffectiveStyleAffective1998; @kahrilasSavoringMomentLink2020; @watsonExtraversionPsychopathologyFacetlevel2015].
PA reflects one’s disposition to experience intense and frequent episodes of pleasant moods [@watsonPositiveAffectivity2009], such as happiness, interest, energy, and self-assurance [@minekaComorbidityAnxietyUnipolar1998; @watsonSpecificityPositiveEmotional2010b] as well as level of pleasurable engagement with one’s environment and ability to respond to positive events [@watsonPositiveAffectivity2009; @watsonPositiveNegativeAffectivity1988; @watsonSpecificityPositiveEmotional2010b].
Further, PA influences reactivity to positive emotions and experiences, as well as disposition to recognize, attend to, and ultimately experience positive emotions [e.g., happiness, interest, energy, and self-assurance; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009].
Moving forward, developing evidence-based strategies to target low positive affectivity and related anhedonic depressive symptoms could be critical to increasing the effectiveness of successful treatment for depression [@forbesNeuralSystemsPositive2005; @kahrilasSavoringMomentLink2020; @siltonRegulatingPositiveEmotions2020a; @treadwayReconsideringAnhedoniaDepression2011].

Common treatments for depression, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication [e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors; @priceNeurocircuitryMoodDisorders2010a] have primarily focused on ameliorating distorted thought patterns and neurotransmitter systems pertaining to negative affect [@argyropoulosAnhedoniaRevisitedThere2013; @beckCognitiveTherapyEmotional1979; @dunnChangesPositiveNegative2019]. 
Dunn and colleagues [-@dunnChangesPositiveNegative2019] investigated the efficacy of therapeutic and pharmacological approaches to treating depression.
Findings showed that high negative affect (i.e. up-regulation of a negative valence system that promotes withdrawal from negative stimuli) and low positive affect (down-regulation of a positive valence system that guides approach to rewarding stimuli) were both important psychological targets in treating depression, and that treatments aimed at enhancing the experience of positive emotions (i.e., enhancing reactivity to positive events/stimuli) in depression may improve efficacy.
Previous depression research that focused on emotion reactivity has generally illustrated attenuated reactivity in response to positive stimuli (i.e., the positive attenuation view and ECI theory); thus, attenuated reactivity to positive stimuli may represent a critical mechanism related to low positive affectivity and anhedonic symptoms in depression. 
Although disordered emotion reactivity to positive stimuli may be influenced by a myriad of intersecting contextual factors and individual differences, emotion reactivity occurs “online,” and in the moment, and likely influences a cascade of other affective events that unfold following initial reactivity. 
Thus, baseline emotion reactivity to positive stimuli may be a critical target for future depression treatments. As such, in the present study, we aimed to examine relations among PA and emotion reactivity to positive stimuli. 

### Regional Brain Activity Implicated in Emotion Reactivity in Non-Clinical and Clinical Samples
#### Non-clinical samples
In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research conducted in non-clinical samples, brain network activity during emotion reactivity to visual stimuli involves a visual-subcortical network including right occipital, visual cortical, and amygdala activation in response to viewing affective stimuli that is modulated by arousal, with some variability in valence effects [@bradleyActivationVisualCortex2003; @langEmotionalArousalActivation1998; @sabatinelliParallelAmygdalaInferotemporal2005]. 
Right occipital cortex [i.e., fusiform cortex, lateral occipital cortex, and medical parietal cortex; @bradleyActivationVisualCortex2003] are implicated in an arousal effect in response to viewing pleasant and unpleasant affective images compared to neutral images. 
The largest changes in brain activity are associated with viewing highly arousing stimuli, regardless of valence [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007].
However, positive emotional stimuli eliciting regional brain activity has been observed [e.g., @frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019], as has greater activity for negative emotional stimuli [@kimNeuralCorrelatesPositive2007].

#### Clinical samples
In individuals with MDD, attenuated ventral striatum activity has been observed in response to positive visual stimuli [@epsteinLackVentralStriatal2006; @lawrenceSubcorticalVentralPrefrontal2004; @surguladzeDifferentialPatternNeural2005].
Ventral striatum activity is associated with processing of rewarding/positive stimuli [@epsteinLackVentralStriatal2006; @fliessbachSocialComparisonAffects2007; @schultzNeuronalActivityMonkey1992].
Attenuated striatum activity has been related to participant’s self-reported lack of interest and pleasure in activities [@epsteinLackVentralStriatal2006; @treadwayReconsideringAnhedoniaDepression2011], which provides support for both the positive attenuation and ECI views of emotion reactivity in depression.
Other studies have found enhanced activity in frontal brain structures involved in emotion regulation (e.g., middle frontal gyrus, cingulate cortex, dorsolateral PFC) during emotion reactivity to positive stimuli in those with MDD [@demenescuNeuralCorrelatesPerception2011; @ochsnerBottomUpTopDownProcesses2009].
This pattern of findings may index increased attention orientation and processing demands to mood-incongruent stimuli [@demenescuNeuralCorrelatesPerception2011]. 
Alternatively, it is possible that patterns of enhanced activity are consistent with the brightening effect [@khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019a; @khazanovPositiveEmotionalitySpecific2016] such that individuals with depression have greater reactivity to positive events and stimuli.

Regarding negative emotion reactivity, studies have indicated increased responsiveness to, and memory for, negative stimuli as illustrated by enhanced amygdala response to negative emotional stimuli [@falesAlteredEmotionalInterference2008; @savitzImagingPhenotypesMajor2009] in those with MDD compared to controls. 
Increased amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli has been observed in those with severe depression [@shelineIncreasedAmygdalaResponse2001], and antidepressant medication regimen may be linked to down-regulation of amygdala response [@fuAttenuationNeuralResponse2004; @lawrenceSubcorticalVentralPrefrontal2004; @shelineIncreasedAmygdalaResponse2001].
In contrast, participants with mild-to-moderate depression severity (with and without medication) do not exhibit differences in amygdala activity in emotion reactivity compared to controls [@demenescuNeuralCorrelatesPerception2011].
Therefore, support for negative potentiation in depression appears contingent upon depression severity.

#### Neuroimaging results presently offer an opaque picture of emotion reactivity in depression 
Based on the existing neuroimaging research, there is not year a clear pattern of support for any of the four existing frameworks regarding abnormalities in emotion reactivity in depression (positive attenuation, negative potentiation, brightening effect, or ECI).
In part this opaque picture may be a result of the relatively slow time course of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response as measured via fMRI, which most likely fails to fully capture the temporal course of emotion reactivity, which is observed early as 100 ms in EEG research [@frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019; @hinojosaN170SensitivityFacial2015; Kahrilas et al., in prep; @stockdaleInfluenceStimulusValence2020]. 
Additionally, individual differences (e.g., differences in depression severity, medication status, and levels of co-occurring anxiety) across studies may be contributing to obscuring clear patterns of brain activity. 

Neuroscience research investigating depression that does not account for co-occuring anxious apprehension and anxious arousal may yield mixed findings [@herringtonLocalizationAsymmetricBrain2010; @sharpTransdiagnosticDimensionsAnxiety2015].
Anxious apprehension refers to a tendency to engage in negative, ruminative thinking, and is analogous to enduring state worry [@burdwoodRestingstateFunctionalConnectivity2016; @ruscioTaxometricInvestigationLatent2001], while anxious arousal entails hypervigilance and sympathetic nervous system hyperarousal to mild stressors [@nitschkeContrastingPatternsBrain1999].
Accounting for co-occurring dimensions of anxiety can help clarify distinct patterns of emotion reactivity and neural activity associated with PA [@herringtonLocalizationAsymmetricBrain2010; @sharpTransdiagnosticDimensionsAnxiety2015].
Altogether, a dimensional approach to measuring depression symptoms in the context of neural emotional reactivity would allow different patterns of neural activity to covary with degrees of illness severity and anxiety comorbidity. 
Therefore, in the present study we included measures of anxious arousal and anxious apprehension in our statistical models in order to more adequately capture distinct relations among low PA and neural activity, with the broad aim of improving the characterization of patterns of neural correlates of emotion reactivity in depression.
Further, fMRI-based neuroimaging research does not capture the temporal course of emotion reactivity, which occurs as early as 100 ms [@frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019; @hinojosaN170SensitivityFacial2015; Kahrilas et al., in prep; @stockdaleInfluenceStimulusValence2020]; thus, it is critical to also undersatnd the temporal course of regional brain activity implicated in emotion reactivity.

### Measuring the Temporal Course of Emotion Reactivity in Depression: Event-Related Potentials Index Dynamic Cascade of Neural Processes

#### Early ERP components
Research conducted by our lab and others have identified early visual ERP components that are reactive to affective stimuli [i.e., N170 & EPN; @frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019; @kahrilasNeurobiologicalCorrelatesEmotioninpreparation].
Studies investigating whether these ERP components are modified in depression have produced mixed findings.
Research from Foti and colleagues [-@fotiReducedElectrocorticalResponse2010] illustrated that early ERP components are unmodified in individuals with MDD compared to individuals without MDD (as indexed by enhanced vertex parietal potential, a component theorized to reflect perceptual processing and encoding of facial stimuli, in response to fearful/angry compared to neutral faces). 
In contrast, Dai and Feng [-@daiMoreExcitedNegative2012] found smaller N170 amplitudes in response to happy faces in sub-clinical MDD cases and enhanced N170 in response to negative faces in clinical MDD cases, which is congruent with the positive attenuation and negative potentiation views. 
Chen and colleagues [-@chenDistinctFacialProcessing2014] noted reduced N170 amplitude in response to happy, neutral, and sad faces in a visual emotions oddball paradigm using face stimuli for individuals with a current first episode of major depression. 
The same study indicated that participants with recurrent depression exhibited enhanced N170 amplitude in response to sad faces and attenuated N170 amplitude in response to happy and neutral faces [@chenDistinctFacialProcessing2014], demonstrating patterns of emotion reactivity that vary as a function of illness history.
Research investigating N170/EPN and emotional reactivity in response to complex affective images (e.g., International Affective Pictures System, or IAPS) in depression is scant, with one study finding enhanced EPN activation in response to negative compared to neutral images for individuals with depression among binge drinkers [@connellBingeDrinkingDepression2015].
Following these findings, we hypothesized that PA would be associated with attenuated N170 and EPN amplitude in response to passively viewing positive stimuli compared to neutral stimuli.
Given the equivocal findings regarding these early components in response to negative images, analyses regarding the relationship between PA and N170/EPN in response to passively viewing negative compared to neutral stimuli were conducted in an exploratory manner.

#### LPP

Affective disorders such as MDD and dysthymia are associated with abnormal emotional reactivity as indexed by the late positive potential (LPP) in response to affective stimuli [@grunewaldAttenuatedLPPEmotional2019]. 
LPP is a sustained positive slow wave EEG component observed starting as early as 300 ms following stimuli onset and is an established index of evaluative congruency, valence, and arousal in response to visual stimuli [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008]. 
LPP has been theorized to reflect activation of a brain network engaged in processing affective visual stimuli, including subcortical structures, particularly the amygdala [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003]. 
LPP over the centroparietal cortex is augmented in the presence of unpleasant and pleasant compared to neutral images [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @dillonDissociationEventrelatedPotentials2006; @fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @hajcakTemporalDynamicsEmotion2007; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003] and is most pronounced for images that are rated as highly arousing [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007]. 

Attenuated LPP in response to both unpleasant and pleasant affective stimuli as been observed in those with MDD [@fotiReducedElectrocorticalResponse2010; @kayserEventrelatedPotentialsERPs2000; @macnamaraDiagnosticSymptombasedPredictors2016], which is consistent with the ECI view of emotion reactivity in depression [@rottenbergEmotionContextInsensitivity2005].
A study conducted by Weinberg and colleagues [-@weinbergDepressionReducedNeural2016] found that, in a sample with diagnoses of MDD and anxiety disorders, a diagnosis of MDD was uniquely associated with attenuated LPP in response to rewarding visual stimuli while a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder was not. 
The aforementioned study did not demonstrate an association with MDD diagnosis and reduced LPP in response to threatening stimuli [@weinbergDepressionReducedNeural2016], thus ultimately showing support for the positive attenuation view of emotion reactivity.
A follow up study found that those with MDD and previous suicide attempts (an index for illness severity) had blunted LPP in response to threatening stimuli compared to those with MDD and without a history of suicide attempts [@weinbergDecreasedNeuralResponse2017].
This effect was unique to threatening (not rewarding) images, which is consistent with fMRI accounts of depression severity altering amygdala activity patterns in response to negative stimuli [@demenescuNeuralCorrelatesPerception2011].
Overall, this illustrates differences in neural reactivity depending on illness severity and further underscores the need for dimensional measures of psychopathology rather than categorical nosology.

Findings that illustrate negative associations among LPP elicited in response to positive and negative images and depression symptoms [@hillAbnormalEmotionalReactivity2019] provide additional support for the ECI view. 
Of note in the Hill and colleagues (2019) study was the use of structural equation modeling (SEM).
In contrast to more ubiquitous OLS regression methods, SEM can explicitly model measurement error, assess overall model fit, and allow for statistical comparison of competing models.
Hill and colleagues (2019) constructed two separate factors: a neural reactivity and internalizing model.
Results from this study indicated that the model corresponding to the ECI view provided the best fit to the data. 
Related, Weinberg and colleagues [-@weinbergDistinctAssociationsLow2018] found blunted LPP in response to rewarding and threatening images in those endorsing lower levels of PA, a pattern of results ultimately lending support to the ECI view.
Thus, we hypothesized that PA would be uniquely and negatively associated with LPP amplitude in response to positive and negative stimuli.

#### Temporal PCA approach to ERPs improve measurement of distinct components across time
Most of the aforementioned research utilizes windowed averages, or area measures, for measuring ERP components.
However, this method is inadequate in dealing with the thorny issue of overlapping components [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978].
For example, there is speculation that N170 modulation due to emotional expressions may be due to superimposed EPN activity [@relleckeEmotionEffectsN1702013].
Similarly, LPP may overlap with P3, a parietally maximal component peaking in the 300-400 ms window that is sensitive to task relevant and motivationally significant stimuli [@polichCognitiveBiologicalDeterminants1995], and even later portions of EPN [@schuppSelectiveProcessingBriefly2004].
To address this issue, we utilized an exploratory temporal principal components analysis (PCA) to better isolate distinct ERP components across time.
PCA is a dimension reduction technique that identifies a new set of variables that are linear combinations of the original variables.
In the context of ERPs, these new variables represent latent components that may not be apparent by visually inspecting ERP averages.
For example, if there were two temporally overlapping ERP components with equal magnitude but opposite directionality (positive and negative), the two components would negate each other and not be observable via inspection of grand average ERPs.
Temporal PCA, on the other hand, would theoretically be able to retain these components provided that the experimental paradigm reliably produces them.
Thus, the present study used a temporal PCA approach to evaluating neural components evoked by emotion reactivity.

### Primary Objectives of the Present Study
In order to clarify the pattern of the temporal course of the neural correlates of emotion reactivity in individuals with depression symptoms, the present study used an SEM approach to evaluate several statistical models characterizing patterns of emotion reactivity (as indexed by N170, EPN, and LPP, derived with PCA) with PA (while accounting for co-occurring anxious arousal and anxious apprehension symptoms). 
With regard to earlier visual components (N170, EPN), we hypothesized that emotion reactivity in response to positive images would be negatively associated with PA. 
No hypotheses were made regarding early visual component activity in response to negative images and its relation to PA, and these analyses were carried out in an exploratory manner. 

## METHOD
### Overview of Study Haromization Approach
In order to facilitate addressing our primary research question regarding the impact of depression symptoms on the neural correlates of emotion reactivity, we strategically harmonized across two college student samples in order to increase variability in the primary variables of interest (e.g., low PA). 
Participants in both samples completed the same self-report symptom measures and underwent the same EEG experimental paradigm (described below in detail). 
The two samples included the following: 1) a unselected non-clinical sample from an EEG experiment (*N* = 52; Kahrilas et al., in prep) and 2) pre-trial baseline (T0) assessment data from a three-month randomized controlled trial that investigated the efficacy of Headspace in mitigating depression symptoms in college students (Supported Mindful Learning Study; SMiLe; *N* = 82). 
Participants who had elevated depression symptoms (PHQ-8 score of 10 or higher) were recruited into the SMiLe study for baseline assessment. 
Only self-report and EEG data from pre-trial baseline assessment were used in the present study. 
Approximately 15 students per each fall and spring semester were recruited over the course of three years (Fall 2017 - Spring 2020) for a total of six semesters. 
After harmonization, the total sample size for the present study was *N* = 134.

### Participants
#### Participant recruitment and inclusion procedures across two studies
a) We recruited a non-selected sample of undergraduate students (N = 52) for an EEG study from a psychology department participant pool (Kahrilas et al., in preparation). 
b) Eighty undergraduate participants with elevated depression symptom scores (score of 10 or higher on the PHQ-8) were invited to participate in the Supported Mindful Learning (SMiLe) study, which was a three-month randomized controlled trial that investigated effectiveness of Headspace [www.headspace.com](www.headspace.com). 
Participants were recruited using listserv emails, flyers, and the psychology department participant pool postings. 
Participants that met inclusion criteria were randomized to one of three experimental groups and completed batteries of surveys at four separate time points. 

To determine eligibility for the SMiLe study, interested participants completed an online screening survey through Opinio. 
Inclusion criteria included the following: participants had to be an undergraduate at the institution from which the study was being conducted, at least 18 years old, and endorse clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms as indicated by a score of greater than 10  on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8, Kroenke & Spitzer, 2002; Kroenke et al., 2009). 
For screening purposes, an eight-item version of the PHQ was utilized with the suicidality item omitted (per IRB request). 
Individuals were excluded if they had a history of neurological conditions or head trauma, regular practice of mindfulness in the past six months [which is consistent with exclusion criteria used in previous research; e.g., @vandamMindHypeCritical2018], 
prior use of the Headspace app within the past six months, and unwillingness to join the peer support group (if randomized to the Headspace with Peer Support group).

Of the 80 participants recruited for the SMiLe study, 72 underwent the EEG paradigm, and 11 participants were excluded from analyses due to large amounts of EEG artifact.
This resulted in a final total of 61 from the SMiLe study.

#### Harmonized participant characteristics
These 61 SMiLe Study participants were harmonized with the sample of 52 from Kahrilas and colleagues' study (in preparation) for a total *n* of 113.
In the harmonized sample, participants were 18 to 29 years old ($M$ = 19.4, $SD$ = 1.64), 75% of which identified as female, 21% as male, 0.9% as transgender, 0.9% as non-binary, and 1.7% as other.
Seventy-one percent identified as heterosexual, 21% as bisexual, 4% as gay, and 4% as a different sexual orientation.
Sixty-nine percent of participants identified as white, 15% Asian, 8% Hispanic or Latinx, 5% Multi-Racial, 1% as Black, and 1% as Other.

### Materials and Procedure
To evaluate depression severity, the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9; @kroenkePHQ9ValidityBrief2001]was administered in the laboratory setting.
PHQ-9 items are scored from “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day) and are based on the depression criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. 
Internal consistency of the PHQ-9 in the present study was good [@georgeSPSSWindowsStep2003; $\omega = .82$].

To assess for positive affectivity and anxious arousal, the 39-item Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (Watson, Clark, et al., 1995; Watson, Weber, et al., 1995) was administered. 
The 14-item positive affectivity (PA) Scale (MASQ-PA14; e.g., “Felt cheerful”) and the 17-item Anxious Arousal Scale (MASQ-AA; e.g., “Startled easily”) were used for subsequent analyses.
Previous literature has supported these oblique factors in two independent samples of individuals at-risk for depression and anxiety (Kahrilas et al., 2020; Kendall et al., 2015; Nitschke et al., 2001).
Participants rated their affectivity and anxiety symptoms using a five-point Likert scale from “1” (not at all) to “5” (extremely).
Consistent with previous research [@bredemeierScreeningDepressiveDisorders2010] the MASQ scales demonstrated good to excellent internal consistency (MASQ-PA14, $\omega = .95$ and MASQ-AA, $\omega = .85$).

To measure anxious apprehension, the 16-item Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer et al., 1990) was administered. 
PSWQ items are rated on a five-point Likert scale from “1” (not at all typical) to “5” (very typical). 
Meyer and colleagues (1990) found a high degree of internal consistency in the PSWQ, and the present study found excellent consistency ($\omega = 0.94$).

#### Emotion task paradigm
64-channel high-density electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded while participants viewed seven blocks of 40 images (280 total trials).
The paradigm used 120 different Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS) images [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
40 of the images were positive, 40 were neutral, and 40 were negative.
All OASIS images were rated on seven point Likert scales in terms of their valence (negative to positive) and arousal (not arousing to very arousing) using a sample recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
The image categories (positive, neutral, and negative) from the OASIS selected for the present study each varied in terms of normative valence ratings.
The negative and positive stimuli categories were matched on arousal ratings. 
The mean normative valence ratings of the images used in the present study from Kurdi and colleague's (2017) norming study (on a scale of one to seven) were 5.71, 4.09, and 2.18 for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.
The mean normative arousal ratings of the images used in the present study from Kurdi and colleague's (2017) norming study (on a scale of one to seven) were 4.46, 1.99, and 4.52, for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.

Each block represented an experimental regulation condition: increase (positive/negative), decrease (positive/negative), and watch (positive/negative/neutral).
During the increase condition, participants were instructed to appraise the picture in a way that will intensify the emotion that is elicited by looking at it.
During the decrease condition, participants were asked to reduce the intensity of the emotion that is elicited by looking at the picture.
When prompted to watch, participants were asked to view the picture as they would naturally.
The passive “watch” blocks served as baseline conditions for LPP component analyses [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
A block design was selected for the proposed study because valenced images outnumber the neutral images two-to-one.
The relatively rare neutral stimuli may produce a P3 if intermixed with valenced stimuli in the same block [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000]. Additionally, LPP signal is increased for stimuli that are perceived as incongruent within a given affective context.
Thus, a neutral stimulus displayed among a series of emotional stimuli would likely evoke an enhanced LPP activity, thus decreasing effect size [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000].
Further, a block design paradigm may better emulate one's natural environment, as stimuli of congruent valence are typically encountered in clusters rather than isolation [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].
Research comparing intermixed and block designs for LPP and EPN have shown comparable findings between the two approaches [@pastorAffectivePicturePerception2008; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].

First, participants completed three practice trials that consisted of 10 images not used during the actual task [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
Participants were instructed to increase or decrease emotional arousal in response to a mixture of positive and negative images, respectively.
Participants were also asked to watch a third practice trial comprised of positive, negative, and neutral images.
Stimuli were presented in random order within each block.
Prior to each practice trial, participants were provided with instructions on how to regulate (increase/decrease) their affective response to the stimuli, or to simply view the stimuli [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
Participants were shown which regulation strategy to engage in (increase, decrease, or watch) at the start of each experimental block.
Once the participant was ready, an OASIS stimulus appeared for 2000 ms [@fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008].
Following stimulus offset, a blank screen appeared for 500 ms followed by a fixation cross for 1500 ms (± 250 ms) for a total ISI of 1750 - 2250 ms (see Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image-2) for a visual depiction of the experimental paradigm used in the present study).
This interval is identical to other studies utilizing the IAPS and investigating LPP [@dunningSeeNoEvil2009; @hajcakMotivatedControlledAttention2009].
Stimuli within each block were presented in random order.
Each block was separated by a break and presented in pseudo-random order, such that no valence (i.e., positive or negative) nor regulation (i.e., increase, decrease, or watch) condition were presented consecutively.
After each experimental block, valence and arousal ratings were collected using a seven-point likert scale and the same instructions used in Kurdi, Lozano, and Banaji’s [-@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] norming study of the OASIS stimuli set.
These ratings were obtained to measure mood manipulation (in terms of valence and arousal) at the end of each experimental block.
Furthermore, difficulty ratings on a seven-point likert scale were also obtained, as to measure the degree of difficulty that participants experienced with each experimental block's instructions.

#### Apparatus and Physiological Recording
Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) was measured while participants completed an emotion regulation task (Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image-2)).
Participants were seated in a comfortable chair, approximately 24 inches from a 24-inch LCD monitor in a quiet, dimly lit room.
Participants were monitored by a task administrator in a nearby room and received task instructions by intercom.
EEG data were recorded using a Biosemi Active2 EEG system.
A custom-designed Falk Minow 64-channel cap with equidistantly spaced BioSemi active Ag and AgCl electrodes was used for data collection.
CMS/DRL was placed near the vertex, and two electrodes were located on the mastoid bones.
After placement of the electrode cap, electrode positions were digitized and quantified in terms of their coordinates on each participant's scalp.
An additional electrode was placed on the inferior edge of the orbit of each eye to monitor vertical eye movements; nearby electrodes in the cap (lateral to each eye) monitored horizontal eye movements.
Data were recorded with a band pass of 0 – 104 Hz at a sampling rate of 512 Hz.

The following EEG data processing steps were implemented in Brain Electrical Source Analysis software [BESA, Version 7; @schergBESABrainElectric1990].
Following the adaptive artifact correction method [@illeArtifactCorrectionOngoing2002], ocular artifacts were corrected using a spatial PCA filter.
EEG data were re-referenced to the average reference of all electrodes for analyses and digitally filtered with 0.01 Hz high-pass and 30 Hz low-pass filters with a cutoff attenuation of 12 dB/octave.
EEG data were re-referenced to the average activity of all electrodes.
While it is convention to re-reference data to average activity of the mastoids for LPP [e.g., @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006], a covariance matrix was utilized in the PCA, which is inherently mean corrected [@dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012].
Thus, minimal effects would be expected as a function of referencing scheme for temporal PCA (though this is not the case for spatial PCA; see @dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012).
Muscle activity and other artifacts were corrected through implementing an algorithmic scan of continuous EEG data in BESA (fixed threshold criteria: amplitude > 120 uV; gradient > 75 uV, low signal <.01 uV).
Data were baseline-adjusted by subtracting the average activity for 200 milliseconds [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] before stimulus onset.

#### Temporal PCA
To discriminate among temporal sources of variance (i.e., ERP components) in the time course of ERPs, ERP averages were submitted to a temporal PCA to derive linear combinations of data that distinguish activity across time points. 
A temporal PCA was performed using the Psych package [@revellePsychProceduresPsychological2020] in R version 4.0.3 [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2020] with a covariance matrix.
A covariance matrix was used to retain the original units of measurement (i.e., voltage) for the average ERPs for each time point [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978].
The temporal PCA used all time points (-200 ms - 2000 ms) as variables and all 113 participants, three blocks (passive positive, negative, and neutral viewing blocks), and 64 recording sites as observations, yielding linear combinations of time points and "temporal" factors [@dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012].
To determine the number of components to retain for rotation, a parallel analysis [@hornRationaleTestNumber1965] was performed on the resultant Scree plot.
The parallel analysis creates Scree plots of the actual and simulated fully random data to determine the number of components that explain more variance than if only chance alone were acting. 
Based on the parallel analysis, 22 components were retained for rotation. 
A Promax rotation was then used on the 22 components because it does not impose orthogonality, and simulation studies suggest that Promax is most effective for temporal PCA [@dienERPPCAToolkit2010; @dienEvaluationPCAICA2007].
The time course of each of the 22 components was inspected by plotting the covariance loadings along each time point. 
To further guide our selection of components, we used a previous study conducted by our lab (Kahrilas et al., in prep) that analyzed the time course of emotion reactivity and regulation using PCA.
PCA components with covariance loadings in time windows that fit descriptions of later and early visual components (e.g., EPN, P300, and LPP) that matched components sensitive to emotion reactivity in a previous study by Kahrilas and colleagues (in prep) were retained for statistical analyses.
Spatial information is retained in PCA; the topography of each factor is encoded in the mean amplitude of factor scores at each recording site [@dienAddressingMisallocationVariance1998].
Thus, scalp topographies of each component for each condition was inspected to determine correspondence of components and ERP components of interest.
Of note, portions of waveforms represented by a given PCA component can be reproduced by multiplying covariance loadings by observations' factor scores [@dienAddressingMisallocationVariance1998]. 
Three components were retained for statistical analyses based inspection of topographic plots and ERP waveforms.
Two of the retained components represented later components that have positive peaks at 371 ms and 736 ms, with the former demonstrating activity at approximately PO7 and PO8 electrode sites and the latter at PO7, PO8, PO3, PO4, P1, P2, P5/P3, P6/P4 and Pz electrode sites. 
Similar to findings from Kahrilas and colleagues' study (in preparation), topography of a 257 ms component indicated a dipole of scalp activity, with positive going waveforms in the occipital region (PO7, PO8, O1, and O2) and negative waveforms in the centroparietal region (CPz and Pz).
Based on our a apriori interest in the EPN, and considering that our research demonstrated EPN activity in response to emotional images (Kahrilas et al., in prep), we submitted the negative centroparietal activity to statistical analyses.
No component resembling an N170 was derived from the PCA.
See Figures \@ref(fig:neg-257-component-plot), \@ref(fig:371-component-plot), and \@ref(fig:736-component-plot) for grand average ERP and topographic plots of the retained components before and after the PCA was performed.
All visualizations were composed using the ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) and eegUtils (Craddock, 2019) packages.

#### Analytical approach

SEM was conducted using the lavaan package [@rosseelLavaanPackageStructural2012].
Further, the first author made extensive use of the dplyr (Wickham et al., 2021) package in data cleaning and manipulation.
Tables were constructed using the kableExtra package (Zhu, 2021).
Our modeling process largely followed that of Hill et al. (2019).
Our first stage of modeling was to construct a measurement model with two latent orthogonal factors (*Reactivity* and *Psychopathology Symptoms*).
Positive, negative, and neutral viewing conditions served as indicator variables of the *Reactivity* factor (See Figure\@ref(fig:sem-diagrams)).
Measures of anxious apprehension (PSWQ), anxious arousal (MASQ-AA), and PA (MASQ-PA) served as indicator variables for the *Psychopathology Symptoms* factor.
Three separate measurement models were constructed for each ERP component retained from the earlier PCA.
Across these measurement models, indicators (positive, negative, and neutral viewing conditions) of the *Reactivity* factor changed to reflect each PCA component being tested, while the *Psychopathology Symptoms* factor remained identical.
The variances of both latent variables were fixed to unity (i.e., a variance of one) to set the metric for factor loading and covariance estimates. All loadings were freely estimated, as were the residual variances of each indicator variable.
Each of the subsequent competing models were compared to their respective measurement model with a chi-square likelihood ratio test to determine of each model offered superior fit to the data compared to the measurement model.

We then tested the ECI model by estimating covariances among the positive/negative viewing conditions and PA. 
While Hill and colleagues (2019) constrained these covariances to be equal, we allowed these values to be freely estimated on the basis that the ECI view makes no hypotheses as to whether the *degree* of blunting is equal for positive and negative images, just the negative directionality.
If both estimated covariances were positive (negative for negative peak waveforms) and significant, and if this model offered superior fit to the data compared to the nested comparison measurement model, then we would interpret this as support for the ECI view.
Allowing these covariances to be freely estimated allowed us to determine if the positive attenuation or negative potentiation views offered superior fit, as well.
If a significant positive (negative for negative peak waveforms) covariance between PA and the positive viewing condition was found with no association with the negative viewing condition, this would be evidence for the positive attenuation theory (in the presence of a significant likelihood ratio test compared to the measurement model).
In contrast, if a significant negative (positive for negative peak waveforms) covariance between PA and the negative viewing condition was found in the absence of an association between the positive viewing condition and PA, this would be evidence for the positive attenuation theory (in the presence of a significant likelihood ratio test compared to the measurement model).
Note that the positive attenuation and negative potentiation views are not mutually exclusive, and these patterns could be observed simultaneously.
Other competing models were directly informed from Hill and colleagues 2019 study.
We then tested an psychopathology symptoms model that estimated covariances among the positive/negative viewing conditions and the latent *Psychopathology Symptoms* factor, which tested whether emotion reactivity was associated with more general psychopathology symptoms rather than PA specifically.
We also tested an anxious arousal model that estimated covariances among the positive/negative viewing conditions and the residual variance of the anxious arousal indicator.
This tested the hypothesis of whether reactivity to emotional stimuli was associated with physiological symptoms associated with anxiety specifically.
Lastly, we also tested an anxious apprehension model that estimated covariances among the positive/negative viewing conditions and the residual variance of the anxious apprehension indicator.
This tested the hypothesis of whether reactivity to emotional stimuli was associated with apprehension symptoms associated with anxiety specifically.
See Figure \@ref(fig:sem-diagrams) for model diagrams of each of the models described.

(ref:sem-diagrams) The model diagrams show each model that was fitted to the data for each ERP component retained from the PCA. The Measurement Model (top left) treats the latent *Reactivity* and *Psychopathology Symptoms* factors as orthogonal constructs. The ECI Model (top right) estimates covariances among the positive/negative viewing conditions for a given ERP component and positive affectivity. The Psychopathology Symptoms Model Diagram (middle) estimates covariances among positive and negative viewing conditions for a given ERP component and global psychopathology symptoms, rather than PA specifically. The Anxious Apprehension model estimates covariances among positive/negative viewing conditions for a given ERP component and anxious apprehension. Last, the Anxious Arousal Model (bottom left) estimates covariances among positive/negative viewing conditions for a given ERP component and anxious arousal. PA = positive affectivity, Anx Aro = anxious arousal, Anx App = Anxious apprehension, ECI = emotion context insensitivity.

```{r sem-diagrams, echo = FALSE, fig.pos="H", out.extra="", fig.cap = "(ref:sem-diagrams)", out.height= "100%", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/paper_3/SEM_diagrams.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

All models were estimated using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) with robust (Huber-White) standard errors and a scaled test statistic. 
Of the 113 cases used for analyses, 10 (8.8%) were missing one questionnaire subscale used for the *Psychopathology Symptoms* latent factor.
Inspection of missing cases did not reveal any indications that these data were missing not at random [@endersIntroductionMissingData2010], and thus FIML was used to address missing data.
Model fit was evaluated with measures of absolute fit, including the goodness-of-fit chi-square value with accompanying degrees of freedom, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) < .06 [@huCutoffCriteriaFit1999], standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) < .08 [@huCutoffCriteriaFit1999].
Fit was also evaluated with measures of relative fit, including non-normed fit index (NNFI) > .90 [@marshSearchGoldenRules2004a], and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) > .90 [@marshSearchGoldenRules2004a].
A chi-square difference test was performed between the nested measurement model and its corresponding ECI, Psychopathology Symptoms, and Anxious Arousal, and Anxious Apprehension model.
The chi-square difference test evaluates the equal-fit hypothesis for two hierarchical models.
If the chi-square difference value is non-significant, then the two models fit the data equally well and the more parsimonious (i.e., measurement model) is the preferred model.
If the chi-square difference value is significant, then the model with fewer degrees of freedom (i.e., not the measurement model) fits the data better and is thus preferred over the measurement model.
The ECI, Psychopathology Symptoms, and Anxious Arousal, and Anxious Apprehension models are not hierarchical and thus cannot be compared using a chi-square difference test.
Thus, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) will be used to determine best fit among these non-nested models, with lower values indicating superior fit
[@markonEmpiricalComparisonInformationtheoretic2004].

## RESULTS
### Arousal and valence effects
A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted with block type (positive, negative, and neutral emotional stimuli) as the independent variable with Greenhouse-Geisser corrections for deviations from sphericity for each of the three ERP components.
Results illustrated that block type explained a significant portion of the variance for each of the three components, 257 ms component: $F(1.95, 218.06) = 50.57$, $\mathit{MSE} = 0.29$, $p < .001$, $\hat{\eta}^2_G = .111$, 371 ms component: $F(1.78, 199.37) = 148.96$, $\mathit{MSE} = 0.13$, $p < .001$, $\hat{\eta}^2_G = .125$, and the 736 ms component: $F(1.90, 212.57) = 78.06$, $\mathit{MSE} = 0.17$, $p < .001$, $\hat{\eta}^2_G = .174$.
We also explored linear (valence: comparing pleasant with threat) and quadratic (arousal: comparing pleasant and threat with neutral) orthogonal univariate trends on the block factor in Table \@ref(tab:poly-tab).
Results indicated significant valence (with greater effects for negative compared to positive emotional stimuli) and arousal effects for each of the components.

### SEM Analyses
All parameter estimates are tabulated in Table \@ref(tab:parameter-estimate-tab).
Model fit indices and chi-square difference test results are contained in Table \@ref(tab:fit-measure-tab).
The anxious arousal, PA, and anxious apprehension variables each loaded significantly onto the *Psychopathology Symptoms* factor, with correlations ranging from moderate to large [@cohenStatisticalPowerAnalysis1988a; .35, -.40, and .89, respectively].
While each sequence of models contained a different ERP component, they each contained the same set of indicator variables for the *Psychopathology Symptoms* factor.
Thus, the factor loadings for this factor remained the same for each model.

(ref:parameter-estimate-tab) Parameter estimates, standard errors, and test statistics from each structural equation model using ERP components retained from PCA ($n$ = 113). Each model contains two factors: $Reactivity$ and $Psychopathology Symptoms$. The $Reactivity$ factor represents the shared variance for each of the passive viewing conditions (positive, negative, and neutral) for each PCA ERP component, and the residual variance of each indicator variable represents that variable's unique variance. The $Psychopathology Symptoms$ factor represents the shared variance of the PA, anxious arousal, and anxious apprehension measures, and the residual variance of each indicator variable represents that variable's unique variance.

### 257 ms Component
The two-factor confirmatory factor analysis measurement model with the 257 ms component did not meet standards for acceptable model fit.
While the CFI > .90, the SRMR, NNFI, and RMSEA indicated poor fit (Table \@ref(tab:fit-measure-tab)).
The positive, negative, and neutral viewing conditions each loaded strongly and significantly on the *Reactivity* factor.
When the positive and negative indicators of the *Reactivity* factor were allowed to covary with the PA indicator of the *Psychopathology Symptoms* factor for the ECI model, model fit drastically improved, with all fit measures satisfying criteria for acceptable model fit (Table \@ref(tab:fit-measure-tab)).
Further, a Satorra-Bentler scaled difference chi-square test that compared the ECI model with the measurement model indicated superior fit to the data ($\Delta\chi^2(2) = 13.52, \ p=.001$; Table \@ref(tab:fit-measure-tab)).
In other words, the ECI model was a superior characterization of the covariance structure compared to a fully orthogonal solution.
Additionally, there was a large, positive correlation between the positive viewing condition and PA ($r = .61,\ p < .001$; Table \@ref(tab:parameter-estimate-tab)).
Of note, since the 257 ms component has a negative peak, this directionality is in the opposite direction hypothesized in the ECI view of emotion reactivity in depression.
More specifically, as self-reported PA increases, the 257 ms attenuates for positive stimuli.
No significant relation was found between the 257 ms component negative viewing condition and PA.

Considering that the directionality of the parameter estimates was in the opposite direction hypothesized for the ECI view of emotion reactivity and given the non-significant covariance of the negative viewing condition indicator and PA, we fit another model to the data in a post-hoc exploratory fashion.
In this model, we dropped the covariance estimate between the negative viewing condition and PA (i.e., constrained the value to zero), which is in line with the brightening effect described in EMA research [e.g., @khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019a].
This model provided excellent fit to the data ($\chi^2(8) = 7.98$, RMSEA = 0.00, SRMR = 0.05, CFI = 1.00, NNFI = 1.00) that was superior to the nested measurement model ($\Delta\chi^2(1) = 9.43,\ p=.002$).
Additionally, this brightening effect model did not result in an appreciable decrement in model fit compared to the ECI model, which has an additional parameter estimate and one fewer degree of freedom ($\Delta\chi^2(1) = 3.38,\ p=.07$).
In line with the brightening effect, we found a large positive effect between the positive condition and PA (Est/Std = 1.942/.48, $SE = 0.57$, $z = 3.43$, $p = .001$), such that decreases in PA (i.e., greater depression) would result in enhanced 257 ms component activity in response to positive stimuli.
The Psychopathology Symptoms, Anxious Arousal, nor the Anxious Apprehension model provided acceptable fit to the data (Table \@ref(tab:fit-measure-tab)), and no significant associations were found by freeing parameters in these models (Table \@ref(tab:parameter-estimate-tab)).

### 371 ms Component
With the 371 ms component *Reactivity* factor, we found acceptable model fit with the measurement model (Table \@ref(tab:fit-measure-tab)).
Each of the positive, negative, and neutral indicator variables loaded strongly onto the *Reactivity* factor ($r = .97, .90, .89$, respectively; Table \@ref(tab:parameter-estimate-tab)).
While each of the subsequent competing models afforded good model fit, none fit the data significantly better than the initial nested measurement model
(Table \@ref(tab:fit-measure-tab)).
None of the freed parameters unique to each competing model were significant.
Of the competing models, the ECI model offered superior fit as indicated by lower AIC and BIC values (Table \@ref(tab:fit-measure-tab)).
Overall, we found that an orthogonal solution that separated the *Reactivity* factor and *Psychopathology Symptoms* factor and all indicator variables offered superior fit to the data.

### 736 ms Component
The 736 ms component measurement model afforded acceptable model fit to the data ((Table \@ref(tab:fit-measure-tab))), and positive, negative, and neutral indicator variables loaded significantly and strongly onto the latent *Reactivity* factor ($r = .81, .75, .68$, respectively, Table \@ref(tab:parameter-estimate-tab)).
Similar to the 371 ms component, we found that the initial measurement model had the best fit to the data.
While competing models had model fit measures indicating acceptable fit, none constituted significantly improved fit to the data compared to the measurement model (\@ref(tab:fit-measure-tab)).
Additionally, we found no significant covariance estimates as a result of freeing parameters in each of the competing models.

## DISCUSSION
In the present study, we sought to evaluate the temporal course of the neural correlates of emotion reactivity in depression by applying PCA and SEM methods.
We examined three separate ERP components retained from a PCA analysis, one that resembled an EPN and two others resembling later components (i.e., P300 and LPP).
Our findings illustrated a unique relation between the positive viewing condition for the 257 ms component and PA, such that decreases in PA were associated with enhanced 257 ms amplitude.
These findings are consistent with the brightening effect [@khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019], and suggests that early visual components may be neural indicator of PA.
This may be crucial information in devising neuroscience informed interventions for those with low PA and depression.

We hypothesized that there were would EPN activity in response to positive stimuli would be negatively associated with depression symptoms (i.e., lower self-reported PA).
We did not make an a priori hypothesis for negative images.
However, our primary hypothesis was not supported.
Rather, we found large, significant effects in the opposite direction. 
More specifically, lower levels of PA (i.e., more depression) were associated with enhanced EPN activity.
No relation was observed among negative emotion reactivity and PA for EPN, and when this relation was constrained to zero, we obtained a model that provided the best fit to the data (albeit marginally).
This pattern of observations does not match any laboratory-based views of emotion reactivity (i.e., positive attenuation, negative potentiation, ECI), which are predicated upon blunted emotion reactivity in response to positive images as a function of depressive symptomatology.
However, it does fit with the brightening effect that has been observed in EMA research, or that those with depression report greater changes in affect in response to positive events [e.g., @khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019a] compared to healthy controls.
Moreover, this effect is specific to MDD compared to anxiety disorders and is specific to positive emotion [@bylsmaEmotionalReactivityDaily2011; @khazanovBrighteningEffectReactions2019a; @peetersEffectsDailyEvents2003; @thompsonEverydayEmotionalExperience2012], which is consistent with the present study's unique relation among EPN activity in response to positive stimuli and PA when accounting for anxious arousal and anxious apprehension symptoms.
The EPN may be capturing neural activity that has greater ecological validity.
Research has found robust relations among EPN and evolutionarily salient stimuli, such as snakes and curvilinear objects [e.g., @langeslagEarlyVisualProcessing2018a; @strienCurvilinearShapesSnake2016].
This literature has explored relations among EPN and negative stimuli that facilitate survival.
It may be that in depression, this pattern of enhanced EPN in response to naturally threatening stimuli is extended to positive stimuli as well.
As such, it may be a viable indicator of dysregulated real world emotion reactivity. 

While our hypotheses for later components were in line with previous laboratory research [e.g., @hillAbnormalEmotionalReactivity2019], our findings in the present study did not support the ECI view of emotion reactivity, (i.e., a negative relation between positive and negative emotion reactivity and PA).
With regards to the 371 ms and 736 ms components, no other models outperformed the initial measurement model.
In other words, our results supported that these components are distinct from psychopathology symptoms.
This finding is inconsistent with a plethora of research that has examined relations between depression symptoms and LPP [@fotiReducedElectrocorticalResponse2010; @hillAbnormalEmotionalReactivity2019; @proudfitDepressionCventrelatedPotentials2015; @weinbergDecreasedNeuralResponse2017; @weinbergDistinctAssociationsLow2018].
There are a number of possible factors contributing to the inconsistent findings.
We used a block design paradigm in the present study in contrast to a more ubiquitous randomized design that may interfere with picture processing and produce an oddball effect [@weinbergDepressionReducedNeural2016].
Further, our relatively narrow focus on low PA as a symptom of depression may contribute to these differences, as others have analyzed relations among slow wave components and more heterogeneous depression symptomatology [e.g., @fotiReducedElectrocorticalResponse2010; @hillAbnormalEmotionalReactivity2019; @weinbergDecreasedNeuralResponse2017].
However, Weinberg and colleagues (2016) also used a block design paradigm and observed a blunted LPP effect in response to rewarding images in a community sample.
Further, Weinberg and Sandre (2018) investigated more granular features of depression symptoms (i.e., low PA, panic) and observed small partial correlations among P300/LPP and positive images with a sample size of 211.
Both of the aforementioned studies utilized windowed averages in their analyses rather than PCA components as the present study has.
Research that uses windowed averages in analyses may run the risk of including superimposed ERP signals in independent/dependent variables, which may conflate the constructs of interest.
Additionally, SEM allowed us to explicitly model measurement error in constructing our latent *Reactivity* and *Psychopathology Symptoms* variables, which represented variance unique to psychophysiological and psychopathology symptoms of interest [@hillAbnormalEmotionalReactivity2019].
In conjunction, PCA and SEM allotted greater precision in our constructs, and thus allowed us to observed more specific and refined associations.
However, our discrepant findings could also simply be a product of type II error that can only be clarified with additional research.
Indeed, the difference in results could be attributed to an amalgamation of differences in samples and analytic choices. 
Further research should clarify the role of these factors in the neural correlates of depressive symptomatology.

With regards to clinical intervention, targeting early affective processes with specificity to the baseline perception of positive stimuli and events may be effective in treating individuals with low PA.
This is supported by research suggesting that depression treatments focused on enhancing positive emotions may improve efficacy as opposed to solely mitigating negative emotions (Dunn et al., 2012, 2017).
Mindfulness-based meditation practices may represent an important component in interventions that aim to boost positive emotions and target low PA symptoms in individuals with depression.
Mindfulness meditation practices and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) emphasize the importance of cultivating non-judgmental attention and awareness in the present moment (Gu et al., 2015) and appear to enhance the capacity for positive emotions (Garland, Farb, et al., 2015; Wielgosz et al., 2019).
MBIs may modify positive valence systems through multiple psychological mechanisms, including modulations in emotional reactivity, enhanced emotion awareness, increased use of cognitive reappraisal, and alterations in reward processes (Wielgosz et al., 2019).

A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Gu and colleagues (2015) indicated that emotional reactivity and self-reported mindfulness and are primary psychological mechanisms driving the efficacy of MBIs for mood disorders. 
Research has also indicated relations between facets of mindfulness and factors in Clark and Watson’s tripartite model (i.e., PA, NA, and anxious arousal). 
Studies using cross-sectional data have illustrated negative associations between specific facets of mindfulness (non-reactivity and non-judgment) and both anhedonic depression (low PA) and general distress (high NA) in participants diagnosed with depression and anxiety (Desrosiers et al., 2013). 
Another study using cross-sectional and longitudinal methods in a non-clinical sample found inverse relations between the mindfulness facets of acting with awareness and non-judging with PA and NA, which suggests that adopting a non-evaluative disposition may serve to mitigate the experience of negative mood and bolster the experience of positive emotion (Raphiphatthana et al., 2016). 
The same study showed that acting with awareness predicted lower levels of anhedonia (i.e., higher PA) one month later, indicating that awareness to present activities may facilitate pleasant experience derived from said activities (Raphiphatthana et al., 2016). 
Other research also supports the importance of awareness in wellbeing.
States of distraction are associated with lower levels of wellbeing, impaired executive functioning, and adverse psychological outcomes [@dahlPlasticityWellbeingTrainingbased2020].
Future work in our lab will seek to investigate changes in EPN as a function of MBIs to further clarify this component as a modifiable neural indicator of low PA in depression.

Other work by our lab (Kahrilas et al., in prep) has illustrated the blurred lines between the temporal courses of the neural correlates of emotion reactivity and regulation. 
Thus, incorporating emotion regulation strategies that bolster positive emotions may also serve to repair early reactivity processes associated with low PA.
This is corroborated by the notion that the brightening effect may stem from more negative expectations for future events in depression [@strunkDepressiveSymptomsAre2006].
Research has illustrated that low expectation for positive events results in *amplified* reactions to positive stimuli [@mcnamaraAdaptiveResponseUncertainty2013].
Savoring-based regulatory strategies are also used to sustain and upregulate positive emotions [@heiyBackBasicsNaturalistic2014; @liuSelectionImplementationEmotion2017].
While savoring, one may eagerly anticipate future positive experiences, focus on ongoing positive experiences as they occur in the present moment, or reminisce about past positive experiences.
With specific relevance to depression, studies aimed at enhancing savoring capacity show that enriching any of the three temporal domains of savoring (reminiscing, savoring the moment, or anticipating) is associated with increased frequency and intensity of positive affect, and decreased negative affect [@bryantDimensionsSubjectiveMental1984; @bryantSavoringNewModel2007; @kahrilasSavoringMomentLink2020].
Training on momentary positive emotion regulation (i.e., memory building, expressing positive emotions) resulted in decreased self-reported depression symptoms when compared to a control group after two weeks [@hurleyResultsStudyIncrease2012].
Intervention studies with older adults have shown that savoring was positively related to decreased depression, increased activity engagement, and increased wellbeing [@smithEffectsSavoringIntervention2017; @smithImpactSavoringAbility2020].
Savoring may improve the capacity to recognize and enjoy positive moments, even during difficult times [@smithEffectsSavoringIntervention2017].
Thus, anticipatory-based interventions aimed at constructing more positive expectations for future events may scaffold more frequent experiences of positive emotions.
Another important consideration is whether the brightening effect stems from a low frequency of positive events.
In support of this notion, individuals with mood disordered groups tend to report fewer pleasant events compared to individuals without mood disorders [@bylsmaEmotionalReactivityDaily2011].
Enhanced reactivity to positive stimuli, then, may be adaptive as to reconcile the fewer opportunities to erode negative mood.
While other researchers have suggested that psychological correlates of low PA emerges only in later attentional stages [@weinbergDistinctAssociationsLow2018], our work underscores the importance of considering the role that earlier affective processes play in depression as well.

While previous research has not observed relations between EPN and PA [@weinbergDistinctAssociationsLow2018], it seems reasonable to attribute this to our use of PCA to isolate these components.
Visual inspection of waveforms indicated that the 371 ms component (which was not found to be related to PA in the present study) starting at around 70 ms, overlapped considerably with the 271 ms peak EPN.
Relying on windowed averages likely would not have successfully captured the EPN component, which may explain these previous null findings. 
While there is no one best way to measure one's ERP data, we do encourage other ERP researchers to add multivariate techniques such as PCA to their analysis toolbox. 

There are several limitations to the present study. 
First, these data are cross sectional and causation cannot be inferred among neural activity and self-report measures. 
Future longitudinal research should focus on studying the relations between low PA and associated neurophysiological factors to further clarify the direction of these relations. 
Further, while our sample contained dimensional variability on constructs of interest (e.g., depression, PA), it is still primarily a white undergraduate sample, which affords limited generalizability. 
Future research studies should incorporate community samples and participants throughout the lifespan. 
Related, research has suggested that older individuals may have higher savoring capacity [@smithSavoringResiliencePsychological2015], which may have implications for EPN and PA and inform intervention strategies for older and younger individuals with depression alike. 
Future work should also employ other EEG methods, such as source analysis, to investigate the time course of specific neural structures and their relation with self-report data. 
This research will elucidate brain-behavior relations within the context of psychopathology and inform clinical and pharmacological interventions. 
Last, despite the methodological rigor of our analytical plan, our results are still merely associations. 
Future researchers should strive to test more intricate theories of how psychophysiological constructs relate to questionnaire-based data (e.g., mediation and moderation). 
Such information regarding mechanisms of change among neurophysiological factors and psychopathology will be crucial to developing more refined and targeted clinical interventions. 
While sample size can be a limitation, SEM is one such analytical framework that is catered to more testing such theories and models. 
For those researchers with smaller sample sizes that wish to test more complex models, partial least squares structural equation modeling allows for such analyses with reduced demands on sample size [@sarstedtTandemAnalysisSEM2020].

### Conclusion
The present study examined relations among three ERP components derived from a temporal PCA using SEM. 
This framework facilitated a more accurate and refined measurement of ERP components. 
Our findings indicated that an early ERP component with a negative peak at 271 ms had a strong inverse relation with PA, consistent with the brightening effect observed in EMA-based depression research. 
This finding suggests that interventions aimed at modulating early affective processes associated with emotion reactivity may bolster PA and reduce depressive symptomatology.
Mindfulness- and savoring-based interventions may particularly effective to this end. Future work should extend our findings in a more diverse, community-based sample and utilize other EEG analysis methods, such as time-frequency and source analysis. 
Last, we encourage other researchers to test more complex and refined theories, perhaps within an SEM framework, to provide more information regarding mechanisms of change among neurobiological factors and self-report data. 
Overall, incorporating these methods may bring us a step closer to bridging the gap between patterns of self-report symptomatology and their neural correlates, in order to provide a more holistic perspective on developing treatments for those with depression and other forms of psychopathology.

<!-- Another limitation is the degree to which we are capturing trait-like characteristics with our measures. -->
<!-- The MASQ asks about symptoms occurring over the past week, while the PSWQ asks participants to rate themselves based on what is "typical or characteristic." -->
<!-- What constitutes a trait, or what constitutes the occurrence of a state, is a thorny issue [e.g., @sharpTransdiagnosticDimensionsAnxiety2015]. -->

<!-- The former was created by estimating covariances among LPP in response to neutral, positive, and negative images and the latter among the depression, anxiety, and stress subscales of the DASS-21. -->
<!-- This allowed the researchers to then estimate covariances among residual variances for each indicator (i.e., observed) variable while controlling for the shared variance among each of the other indicator variables. -->
<!-- For example, this technique allows the user to estimate relations between the unique variances of each each viewing condition for a specified ERP component and specific facets of psychopathology. -->
<!-- This method affords more flexibility, the ability to test more intricate theories, and is also more reliable than calculating mean difference scores (e.g., difference in LPP elicited between positive and neutral images) by allowing examination of variance that is unique to a given condition [@cronbachHowWeShould1970; @weinbergHeritabilityNeuralResponse2015]. -->
<!-- By comparing Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria, Hill and colleagues (2019) found that the model corresponding to the ECI view provided the best fit to the data. -->
<!-- Additionally, parameter estimates that approached significance (*p* = .05) were found between LPP in response to positive/negative images and depression symptoms [@hillAbnormalEmotionalReactivity2019]. -->
<!-- A notable omission in the aforementioned study were likelihood ratio tests between the nested comparison and baseline models. -->
<!-- This information would inform the reader as to whether the various statistical models actually fit the data better that the initial measurement model that treated the neural reactivity and internalizing factors as entirely orthogonal constructs. -->
<!-- Further, the depression subscale of the DASS-21 gives emphasis to anhedonia, hopelessness, and devaluation of life, and is thus not specific to low PA [@lovibondManualDepressionAnxiety1996]. -->
<!-- Our SEM analytic strategy was similar to that of Hill and colleagues (2019) with some key differences. -->
<!-- Hill and colleagues utilized windowed averages to derive measures of LPP, while we implemented a temporal PCA. -->
<!-- Further, while Hill and colleagues focused on LPP, we expanded our analyses to include three separate components that were sensitive to emotional stimuli. -->
<!-- Additionally, we took a adopted a more granular approach in measuring depression symptomatology by focusing on PA, as informed by literature surmising a distinct relation between this construct and emotion reactivity [@weinbergDistinctAssociationsLow2018] and to investigate patterns of neural reactivity are associated with this specific facet of depression. -->
<!-- Last, we conducted chi-square difference tests comparing each model with its respective measurement model to determine if the additional parameters in each model constituted a significantly superior fit to the data compared to an orthogonal solution. -->
<!-- #### ADD THIS TO THE DISCUSSION SECTION -->
<!-- Measuring relations among neural activity and specific facets of depression are important considerations given the heterogeneity inherent in depression [@monroeDepressionShroudHeterogeneity2015]. -->
<!-- Indeed, more granular assessments of psychopathology will afford more targeted interventions and refined theories of how self report data relate to neurobiological constructs. -->
<!-- Cut Text from the discussion section: -->
<!-- These components were similar to a previous study conducted by our lab (Kahrilas et al., in preparation), where we found these components to be sensitive to affective stimuli (negative and positive  relative to neutral). No N170 component was observed in the present study, suggesting that our block design paradigm consisting of complex affective images did not elicit this component.  It may be that this component is unique to facial processing, rather than complex affective stimuli. -->
