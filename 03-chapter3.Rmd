## THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF POSITIVE EMOTIONS
### Savoring and Positive Affectivity
Healthy emotion regulation abilities are integral to wellbeing [@grossEmergingFieldEmotion1998; @grossEmotionRegulationMental1995; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009; @sapolskyStressStressrelatedDisease2007].
Emotion regulation generally refers to individuals’ attempts to influence their emotional states [@carlPositiveEmotionRegulation2013], including modulation of positive and negative emotional states that are emotionally arousing [@koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009].
This also includes attenuating upsetting, or enhancing positive, aspects of a situation [@grossEmergingFieldEmotion1998].
Poor emotion regulation strategies are associated with reduced social functioning, such as avoidance of close relationships, few positive relationships, and disinclination to share emotions with others [@grossAntecedentandResponsefocusedEmotion1998; @grossEmotionRegulationAffective2002; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009], as well as lower self-esteem and life satisfaction [@grossAntecedentandResponsefocusedEmotion1998; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009; @ochsnerRethinkingFeelingsFMRI2002].
Poor emotion regulation is also associated with bullying and victimization among youth [@walcottRelationDisinhibitionEmotion2004], physical ailments such as hypertension and coronary heart disease [@hintonMechanismsEfficacyCBT2009; @jorgensenElevatedBloodPressure1996], exacerbated cortisol reactivity to stressors [@wirtzLowSocialSupport2006], and impaired cognitive functioning [@keenanEmotionDysregulationRisk2000; @ochsnerRethinkingFeelingsFMRI2002].

While emotion regulation is often associated with decreasing negative emotion, it also pertains to increasing positive emotion, or savoring.
Savoring refers to an awareness of positive experiences and the use of positive emotion regulation strategies to enhance and extend positive feelings that are derived from those experiences [@bryantFourfactorModelPerceived1989; @bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a; @bryantSavoringNewModel2007; @bryantUnderstandingProcessesThat2011; @smithSavoringWellbeingMapping2017].
People initiate savoring responses in reaction to a positive event or affect as a way to maintain, intensify, or prolong the initial positive experience [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007].
While savoring, one may reminisce about past positive experiences, focus on ongoing positive experiences as they occur, or anticipate the enjoyments of future positive experiences [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007].
Regardless of the temporal focus, savoring processes regulate positive emotions in the present moment.

The original conceptual formulation of savoring [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007] is predicated on the assumption that people typically initiate savoring responses in reaction to positive events or affect, which people regulate through cognitive or behavioral strategies. Thus, it is theoretically not possible to savor if one is able to process positive emotions. This underscores the relevance of a different trait-like attribute related to positive emotion, positive affectivity (PA). PA refers to one's disposition to experience positive affect, or more transient positive emotions (e.g., happiness, interest, energy, and self-assurance) and level of pleasurable engagement with one's environment, [@watsonPositiveAffectivity2009; @watsonPositiveNegativeAffectivity1988; @watsonSpecificityPositiveEmotional2010b] and is theorized to represent a stable individual difference.

Savoring and PA are associated with a number of positive outcomes.
Research has indicated that those with a greater capacity to savor possess increased life satisfaction, affective intensity, and self-esteem [@bryantUnderstandingProcessesThat2011].
Past research has also revealed that savoring is related to present happiness, total percent of time feeling happy versus sad, extraversion, optimism, and self-esteem.
Furthermore, savoring is negatively associated with depression, neuroticism, and hopelessness [@bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a; @eisnerPositiveAffectRegulation2009; @houSavoringModeratesAssociation2016; @ramseyAgeDifferencesSubjective2014; @smithSavoringResiliencePsychological2015].
A separate study found that savoring the moment is related to higher life satisfaction, subjective happiness, and overall higher levels of positive affect [@hurleyResultsStudyIncrease2012].
Other research has similarly revealed that savoring was strongly related to higher levels of present happiness, higher self-esteem, and lower reported levels of depression [@bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a].
Furthermore, increased savoring capacity is associated with pain resilience [@thongBufferingRolePositive2016].
PA may be a key variable influencing overall wellbeing, and strong links have been found between PA and health [@cohenPositiveAffectHealth2006].
Higher levels of PA have also been associated with improved sleep quality, more exercise, and lower levels of the stress hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol [@cohenPositiveAffectHealth2006]. 
Additionally, PA has been hypothesized to increase levels of hormones and neurotransmitters, such as oxytocin and growth hormone, as well as endogenous opioids [@pressmanDoesPositiveAffect2005a]. 
PA also promotes prosocial behavior, empathy, forming closer relationships, and larger social networks [@morelliNeuralComponentsEmpathy2014], which are factors that positively impact overall health outcomes [@cacioppoLonelinessHealthPotential2002; @cohenPositiveAffectHealth2006].
In sum, savoring and PA may be key mechanisms in deriving vitality from our lives.

Savoring and PA may have the potential to improve treatment of depression.
45-65% of those with depression undergoing common treatments for depression (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy and psychotropics; @priceNeurocircuitryMoodDisorders2010a) do not achieve remission [@derubeisCognitiveTherapyVs2005].
These common treatments address distorted thought patterns and neurotransmitter systems associated with negative emotions [@argyropoulosAnhedoniaRevisitedThere2013; @beckCognitiveTherapyEmotional1979] despite the fact that patient definitions of of depression recovery emphasize repair of PA and NA equally [@demyttenaereWhatImportantBeing2015].
Additionally, research has shown that NA and PA are both uniquely associated with depression and that current treatments do little to bolster PA [@dunnChangesPositiveNegative2019].
Further, reductions in PA have been shown to be a more pressing intervention target for those with depression [@dunnChangesPositiveNegative2019].
The importance of positive emotion regulation in depression treatment is underscored by the fact that novel treatments have theorized that increased use of dampening appraisals may be a psychological mechanism of reduced PA [@dunnTurningGoldLead2018] and that greater levels of savoring beliefs are negatively associated with depression symptoms [@bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a; @eisnerPositiveAffectRegulation2009; @houSavoringModeratesAssociation2016; @ramseyAgeDifferencesSubjective2014; @smithSavoringResiliencePsychological2015].
A more thorough understanding of the neural correlates of PA and savoring may facilitate neuroscience-informed clinical interventions aimed at increased savoring capacity and mitigating depression.

### Neural Correlates of PA and Savoring
Research utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) has implicated the late positive potential (LPP), a sustained positive slow wave observed starting as early as 300 ms following stimuli onset, as an established index of evaluative congruency, valence, and arousal in response to visual stimuli [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
Research has consistently shown that LPP over the centroparietal cortex is augmented in the presence of unpleasant and pleasant compared to neutral images [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @dillonDissociationEventrelatedPotentials2006; @fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @hajcakTemporalDynamicsEmotion2007; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
LPP is most pronounced for images that are rated as highly arousing [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007] and, as such, has been theorized to reflect activation of a brain network engaged in processing affective visual stimuli, including subcortical structures, particularly the amygdala [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].

Enhanced LPP has been observed when affective images were described in more negative (compared to neutral) terms [@fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008] and when participants are instructed to evaluate images in affective (compared to non-affective) conditions [@hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006].
Other research has shown reduced LPP when participants were instructed to suppress emotional intensity in response to viewing highly arousing affective images [e.g., @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006]. However, research has not reliably demonstrated that LPP is enhanced when participants are instructed to enhance their emotional intensity in response to negative [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] and positive [@krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008] affective stimuli.
However, there are methodological factors possibly contributing to these inconsistent findings (e.g., relatively short stimulus duration compared to other studies that successfully captured emotional enhancement of affective stimuli; @ochsnerBetterWorseNeural2004).
Additionally, past fMRI research has found correlations between personality trait measures and neural activation in response to emotional stimuli [@canliAmygdalaResponseHappy2002; @canliFMRIStudyPersonality2001]. Thus, trait measures such as PA and savoring capacity may explain additional variance in affective neural processing.

### The Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS)
Much of the aforementioned research has utilized the International Affective Picture System [IAPS; @langInternationalAffectivePicture2008].
The IAPS is a set of color pictures that span a range of semantic categories, and valence/arousal ratings derived from a normative sample are provided for each image.
The IAPS was developed to provide a standardized stimulus set of emotional images to facilitate the comparison of results across different studies, and enhance replication across research groups [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007].
IAPS images are rated with respect to valence (negative-to-positive) and arousal (low-to-high) on a nine-point visual analogue scale.
The IAPS has been used in a number of studies investigating neural correlates of affective processing and emotion regulation [e.g., @fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @kimNeuralCorrelatesPositive2007; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
The copyright agreement that accompanies the IAPS mandates that users cannot place any of the images on computer-accessible websites.
This poses considerable restraint on increasing reliance on online samples in behavioral research that make data collection from large and diverse samples faster, less costly, and more efficient [@berinskyEvaluatingOnlineLabor2012; @buhrmesterAmazonMechanicalTurk2011; @krautPsychologicalResearchOnline2004; @masonConductingBehavioralResearch2012; @paolacciRunningExperimentsAmazon2010].
Thus, there is an increasing demand for images with standardized valence and arousal ratings for behavioral researchers to use in online contexts.
Kurdi, Lazano, and Banaji [-@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] heeded this call with the Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS).
The OASIS is a collection of 900 high quality images collected from open-access online sources depicting a range of categories (people, animals, objects, & scenes).
The OASIS was normed on valence and arousal ratings collected from a diverse sample recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
To facilitate experimental control in the selection of stimuli and facilitating comparison of results and replication across different studies using this new image set, the present study utilized OASIS stimuli in lieu of the IAPS.

### The present study
Past research utilizing EEG has indicated that higher arousal in response to stimuli yields augmented LPP signals [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000; @thiruchselvamTemporalDynamicsEmotion2011; @trittIdeologicalReactivityPolitical2016].
Given that PA is associated with more positive emotional arousal, it was hypothesized that the relationship between LPP signals and viewing positive stimuli will be dependent upon levels of PA.
LPP is theorized to be indicative of an interaction between amygdala and cognitive control structures [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
Furthermore, savoring capacity is positively associated with affect intensity and is indicative of one’s ability to bolster positive emotion [@bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a].
Therefore, higher self-report ratings of one’s capacity to savor were expected to moderate the relationship between LPP and increased emotional intensity in response to positive stimuli. 

The present study had two primary objectives.
The first objective of the proposed study was to investigate the relationship between highly arousing affective vs. neutral OASIS stimuli and parietal cortical activity (LPP).
It was hypothesized that a) highly arousing positive vs. neutral OASIS stimuli would be associated with greater LPP activity and b) highly arousing negative vs. neutral OASIS stimuli would be associated with greater LPP activity. Related, it was also hypothesized that LPP would be modulated in a manner congruent with the regulatory goal. More specifically, LPP reduction would be noted in decrease conditions compared to passive watch conditions, and LPP enhancements would be noted in increase conditions compared to passive watch conditions. 
The second objective was to examine the relationship between personality traits pertaining to positive emotion and LPP activity.
It was predicted that a) PA would moderate the relationship between watching positive images and LPP activity and b) savoring capacity would moderate the relationship between increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images and LPP activity.

### Exploratory analyses
The aforementioned aims and hypotheses were preregistered (link: [https://osf.io/p5ba9/](https://osf.io/p5ba9/)).
Exploratory analyses were also conducted and, thus, should be interpreted with caution.
In addition to the LPP, the N170 and early posterior negativity (EPN) are also modulated by affective stimuli [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].
The N170 is a negative peak occurring approximately 170 ms following stimulus presentation at bilateral occipito-temporal sites [@blauFacespecificN170Component2007] and is thought to reflect rapid structural encoding of faces, with more negative N170 amplitudes being associated with threat-related and positive facial expressions compared to neutral facial expressions [@blauFacespecificN170Component2007; @dasilvaDissociatingNeuralTime2016; @stockdaleInfluenceStimulusValence2020].
Enhanced (i.e., more negative) N170 has also been observed in response to negatively-valenced complex affective images (i.e., IAPS; @bekhterevaAttentionalBiasAffective2015), albeit with a later peak latency compared to face stimuli (160 - 200 ms for face stimuli and 200 - 240 ms for IAPS).
Thus, it was hypothesized that highly arousing positive and negative OASIS images may elicit more negative N170 relative to neutral OASIS images.

The EPN has been observed as a relative negative difference for stimuli as emotionally arousing/valenced compared to neutral stimuli in the 200 - 300 ms window over bilateral occipital-parietal sites [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000; @schuppAttentionEmotionERP2003] with potential sources residing in the occipital cortex and contributions from parietal regions [@wiensNonemotionalFeaturesSuppress2011].
For example, Yoon et al. [-@yoonEnhancedEarlyPosterior2016] found that EPN in response to happy and fearful faces were augmented (i.e., enhanced negativity) compared to neutral faces among healthy controls.
Further, those with anxiety disorders exhibited greater EPN in response to fearful compared to happy and neutral faces, suggesting that those with anxiety disorders may have enhanced selective attention for fearful faces [-@yoonEnhancedEarlyPosterior2016].
Other research has observed augmented EPN in response to pleasant compared to unpleasant complex emotional stimuli, suggesting a "pleasure bias" [@frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019].
EPN has been observed across a variety of different tasks, inter-stimulus intervals (ISI), and stimulus presentation durations [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008], leading researchers to surmise that EPN reflects relatively automatic processes observed even when processing resources are limited due to rapid presentation rates [@junghoferFleetingImagesNew2001; @schuppAttentionEmotionERP2003; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
This sensitivity may index rapid affective amygdala processing of emotionally salient information [@ledouxEmotionCluesBrain1995; @morrisConsciousUnconsciousEmotional1998] and is also theorized to indicate "natural selective attention" where evaluation of image features is contingent upon affectively arousing perceptual characteristics for additional processing [@dolcosEventrelatedPotentialsEmotional2002; @schuppSelectiveProcessingBriefly2004].
Thus, highly arousing positive and negative OASIS images may elicit augmented EPN relative to neutral OASIS images.

Some research has indicated that N170 and EPN are sensitive to emotion regulation.
Herbert and colleagues [-@herbertNoFearNo2013] found that EPN signals were significantly attenuated during active downregulation of emotional intensity in response to pictures of fearful faces.
Such effects were not found for downregulation of emotional intensity in response to happy faces [@herbertNoFearNo2013].
Another study analyzed N170 and EPN differences among participants with low and high trait anxiety in an implicit emotion regulation task in response to pictures of facial expressions [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018].
Findings illustrated that implicit emotion regulation processing led to more significant decreases in behavioral negative emotion experience scores, and that these decreases in negative emotion experience scores were correlated with enhanced N170 and EPN [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018].
Lastly, these enlargements were observed for participants with low trait anxiety but not high trait anxiety, suggesting deficits in implicit emotion regulation among those with anxiety [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018].
However, other research has shown that implicit emotion regulation modifies N170, but not EPN, suggesting that implicit emotion regulation may be implemented in earlier perceptual stages of emotion processing rather than later selective attention stages (i.e., EPN & LPP; @wangTemporalCourseImplicit2017).
Given these inconsistent findings and the scarce research investigating the relationship between explicit emotion regulation (as utilized in the present study), no hypotheses were made regarding the relationship among regulation conditions (i.e., increasing/decreasing emotional intensity in response to positive/negative images) and N170/EPN. 

As noted earlier, those with higher levels of PA gain more pleasure and exhibit more responsivity to positive stimuli [@grossRelationsAffectPersonality1998; @rustingExtraversionNeuroticismSuceptibility1997].
Previous research has indicated relationships between extraversion (a personality trait related to PA) and BOLD response of subcortical structures to positive stimuli [@canliFMRIStudyPersonality2001].
One of the aforementioned structures in the aforementioned line of research, the amygdala, is also theorized to contribute to N170 and EPN [@vuilleumierDistantInfluencesAmygdala2004].
Research has supported a "pleasure bias" in EPN reactivity, illustrating selective enhanced signals in response to positive stimuli [@frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019].
Additionally, research has drawn associations between trait anxiety and N170/EPN [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018], suggesting that these components may be influenced by other trait-like characteristics, such as PA and savoring capacity.
Thus, EPN activity in response to positive vs. neutral images may be contingent upon PA.
Considering the fact that N170 and EPN is are theorized to be rather automatic discrimination processes [@pietrekNeuromagneticIndicationDysfunctional2012], no hypotheses were made regarding the relationship between N170/EPN, regulation conditions, and savoring capacity.

Research has indicated enhanced frontal LPP as an index of increased cognitive effort [@bernatEffectsInstructedEmotion2011; @moserNeuralMarkersPositive2014; @shafirEmotionalIntensityInfluences2015]. 
Moser et al. (2014) and Shafir et al. (2015) both observed augmented frontal LPP at Fz electrode sites when positively reappraising relative to passively watching negative images in the 800 ms - 1100 ms time window. 
Bernat and colleagues (2011) also observed enhanced right frontal LPP in response to suppression and enhancement conditions in response to negative stimuli. 
In the context of emotion regulation, frontal LPP is only observed while using positive reappraisal strategies rather than distraction [@shafirEmotionalIntensityInfluences2015]. 
In other words, frontal LPP appears to be contingent upon cognitive exertion, which is underscored by research observing recruitment of frontal neural structures (PFC and ACC) during control efforts [@millerIntegrativeTheoryPrefrontal2001; @ochsnerBetterWorseNeural2004]. 
While extant literature has not investigated frontal LPP in the context of positive images, research suggests that similar frontal processes are engaged in response to regulating emotion in response to positive and negative images [@kimNeuralCorrelatesPositive2007]. 
Thus, it was hypothesized that enhanced frontal LPP would be observed during regulation conditions relative to passive watch conditions (i.e., increasing/decreasing vs. passively watching for both positive and negative stimuli).
However, it was not predicted that frontal LPP would vary between passive watch conditions (i.e., passively viewing positive, negative, or neutral images) since observation of this component appears predicated on the engagement of frontal regions implicated in attention control.

Other exploratory analyses will focus on characterizing the relationship between behavioral ratings for emotional valence (negative to positive), emotional intensity (not arousing to highly arousing), regulatory blocks, and personality trait measures (PA and savoring capacity).
Research has demonstrated that highly arousing positively- and negatively-valenced images are associated with heightened behavioral ratings [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
Thus, it is hypothesized that passively viewing negative and positive images compared to neutral images will result in heightened arousal ratings, as well as decreased (for negative images) and increase (for positive images) valence ratings.
Further, it is expected that regulation conditions will result in behavioral ratings consonant with the regulatory goal: arousal ratings will be heightened for increase conditions and lowered for decrease conditions and valence ratings will be closer to the midpoint of the valence ratings scale for decrease conditions and lower when increasing emotional intensity in response to negative images and higher when increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images relative to passive watch conditions, respectively.
Last, trait measures of PA and savoring capacity are associated with heightened reactivity and more positive affect [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009].
Thus, it was hypothesized that the difference in behavioral/valence ratings between  passively watching positive vs. neutral images would be positively moderated by PA and the difference in behavioral/valence ratings between increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images vs. passively watching positive images would be positive moderated by savoring capacity.

## Specific Aims and Hypotheses
1. *Examine the relationship between EEG components of interest/behavioral ratings and highly arousing OASIS stimuli*. It is hypothesized that highly arousing positive and negative images will be associated with enhanced N170, EPN, and LPP. Further, it is hypothesized that highly arousing positive and negative images will be associated with arousal and valence behavioral ratings.
2. *Examine EEG component/behavioral rating contrasts among regulatory conditions for positive and negative OASIS stimuli*. It is hypothesized that, relative to passive watch conditions for positive and negative image blocks, there will be modulations in N170, EPN, LPP, and behavioral ratings that are consistent with the regulatory goal (e.g., enhanced and attenuated LPP in increase and decrease conditions, respectively). In contrast, it is hypothesized that there will be enhancements in frontal LPP for all regulation conditions relative to passive watch conditions.
3. *Examine the role of trait measures pertaining positive emotion in neural affective processing of affective visual stimuli*. It is hypothesized that the difference in LPP and behavioral ratings between watching neutral images and watching positive images will vary depending on PA. It is also hypothesized that the difference in LPP and behavioral ratings between watching positive images and increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images will vary depending on savoring capacity. No hypotheses were made regarding N170, EPN, and frontal LPP, though these analyses will be conducted in an exploratory manner.

## Method 
### Participants
Healthy participants (*N* = 40) will be recruited from a pool of undergraduate students. The study will be approved by the Institutional Review Board and informed consent will be provided to all participants prior to beginning the experiment.

### Materials and Procedure
#### Questionnaire Measures
Participants will be asked to complete the trait Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) to assess for PA.
Participants will also complete the Savoring Beliefs Inventory (SBI; Bryant, 2009).
The SBI measures the perception of one’s ability to feel pleasure through anticipating positive outcomes, savoring positive moments, and reminiscing about past positive events (Bryant, 2009).
Only the momentary savoring subscale will be used in the following analyses, as this temporal domain is most relevant to the present hypotheses and experimental paradigm.

#### Emotion Task Paradigm
64-channel high-density electroencephalography (EEG) data will be recorded while participants view seven blocks of 40 images (280 total trials).
The study will use 120 different Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS) images [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
40 of the images will be positive, 40 will be neutral, and 40 will be negative.
Previous research has shown that 40 trials is sufficient to evoke a reliable late positive potential (LPP) component [@fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
The mean normative valence ratings (on a scale of one to seven) are 5.71, 4.09, and 2.18 for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.
The mean normative arousal ratings (on a scale of one to seven) are 4.46, 1.99, and 4.52, for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.

Each block will represent an experimental regulation condition: increase (positive/negative), decrease (positive/negative), and watch (positive/negative/neutral).
During the increase condition, participants will be instructed to appraise the picture in a way that will intensify the emotion that is elicited by looking at it.
During the decrease condition, participants will be asked to reduce the intensity of the emotion that is elicited by looking at the picture.
When prompted to watch, participants will be asked to view the picture as they would naturally.
The passive “watch” blocks will serve as baseline conditions for EEG component/behavioral rating analyses [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
A block design was selected for the proposed study because valenced images outnumber the neutral images two-to-one.
The relatively rare neutral stimuli may produce a P3 if intermixed with valenced stimuli in the same block [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000]. Additionally, LPP signal is increased for stimuli that are perceived as incongruent within a given affective context.
Thus, a neutral stimulus displayed in a series of emotional stimuli would likely evoke an enhanced LPP activity, thus decreasing effect size [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000].
Further, a block design paradigm may better emulate one's natural environment, as stimuli of congruent valence are typically encountered in clusters rather than isolation [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].
Research comparing intermixed and block designs for LPP and EPN have shown comparable findings between the two approaches [@pastorAffectivePicturePerception2008; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].

First, participants will complete three practice trials consisting of 10 images not used during the actual task [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
Participants will instructed to increase or decrease emotional arousal in response to a mixture of positive and negative images.
Participants will also be asked to watch a third practice trial comprised of positive, negative, and neutral images.
Stimuli will be presented in random order within each block.
Prior to each practice trial, participants will be provided with instructions on how to regulate (increase/decrease) their affective response to the stimuli, or to simply view the stimuli [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
Participants will also be shown which regulation strategy to engage in (increase, decrease, or watch) at the start of each experimental block.
Once the participant is ready, an OASIS stimulus will appear for 2000 ms [@fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008].
Following stimulus offset, a blank screen will appear for 500 ms followed by a fixation cross for 1500 ms (± 250 ms) for a total ISI of 1750 - 2250 ms (see Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image) for a visual depiction of the experimental paradigm to be used in the present study).
This interval is identical to other studies utilizing the IAPS and investigating LPP [@dunningSeeNoEvil2009; @hajcakMotivatedControlledAttention2009].
Stimuli within each block will be presented in random order.
Each block will be separated by a break and presented in pseudo-random order, such that no valence (i.e., positive or negative) nor regulation (i.e., increase, decrease, or watch) condition are presented consecutively.
After each experimental block, valence and arousal ratings will be collected using a seven-point likert scale and the same instructions used in Kurdi, Lozano, and Banaji’s [-@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] norming study of the OASIS stimuli set.
Furthermore, difficulty ratings on a seven-point likert scale will also be obtained.

```

### Apparatus and Physiological Recording
Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) will be measured while participants completed an emotion regulation task (Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image)).
Participants will seated in a comfortable chair, approximately 24 inches from a 24-inch LCD monitor in a quiet, dimly lit room.
Participants will monitored by a task administrator in a nearby room and receive task instructions by intercom.
EEG data will be recorded using a Biosemi Active2 EEG system.
A custom-designed Falk Minow 64-channel cap with equidistantly spaced BioSemi active Ag and AgCl electrodes will be used for data collection.
CMS/DRL will be placed near the vertex, and two electrodes will be located on the mastoid bones.
After placement of the electrode cap, electrode positions will digitized.
An additional electrode will be placed on the inferior edge of the orbit of each eye to monitor vertical eye movements; nearby electrodes in the cap (lateral to each eye) will monitor horizontal eye movements.
Data will be recorded with a band pass of 0 – 104 Hz at a sampling rate of 512 Hz.

The following EEG data processing steps will be implemented in Brain Electrical Source Analysis software [BESA, Version 7; @schergBESABrainElectric1990].
Following the adaptive artifact correction method [@illeArtifactCorrectionOngoing2002], ocular artifacts will be corrected using a spatial PCA filter.
EEG data will be re-referenced to the average activity of the mastoid electrodes for LPP analyses [@hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006] and average reference of all electrodes for EPN and N170 analyses [@stockdaleInfluenceStimulusValence2020; @yoonEnhancedEarlyPosterior2016] and digitally filtered with 0.01 Hz high-pass and 30 Hz low-pass filters with a cutoff attenuation of 12 dB/octave
Muscle activity and other artifacts will be corrected through implementing an algorithmic scan of continuous EEG data in BESA (fixed threshold criteria: amplitude > 120 uV; gradient > 75 uV, low signal <.01 uV).
Data will be baseline-adjusted by subtracting the average activity for 200 milliseconds [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] before stimulus onset.

LPP activity will calculated as the average activity in the 400 – 800 ms window at the Pz electrode site.
Adaptive means for N170 and EPN will be computed separately to account for peak latency variability among participants. N170 will defined as the minimum mean-peak amplitude (average amplitude across +/- 15 ms around the peak) between 130 - 200 ms post-stimulus at PO7 and PO8 electrode sites. The EPN will defined as the minimum mean-peak amplitude (average amplitude across +/- 25 ms around the peak) detected between 225 to 325 ms post-stimulus at PO7 and PO8 electrode sites.
The experiment will be computer-administered using E-Prime 2.0 software [@schneiderEPrimeUserGuide2002] in order to manipulate the timing and presentation of stimuli.
All stimuli will be presented in color and occupy the entirety of the 21-inch monitor.
The viewing distance will be approximately 24 in. and occupied 25° of the vertical visual angle and 30° horizontally (Cuthbert et al., 2000; Hajcak & Nieuwenhuis, 2006).

## Analytic Plan
### Preliminary Analyses
Prior to hypothesis testing variables will be evaluated for psychometric and distributional properties.
Descriptive statistics for key variables and demographics will be assessed. 
Bivariate correlations for these variables will also be calculated to assess for relationships
between variables. 
Statistical assumptions will be assessed via visual inspection of diagnostic plots (i.e., residual, QQ, scale-location, and residuals vs. leverage) generated with the performance package [@ludeckePerformanceAssessmentRegression2019].

### Analytic Plan for Aim One
A repeated measures analysis variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to assess for differences in relevant EEG components/behavioral ratings among passive watch conditions (neutral, positive and negative). Block type will be entered as the within subject factor and separate analyses will be conducted each with relevant EEG components/behavioral ratings as the outcome. The Tukey method will be used to correct for families of three estimates per analysis.

### Analytic Plan for Aim Two
A repeated measures analysis variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to assess for differences in relevant EEG components/behavioral ratings among passive regulation conditions (watch, increase, & decrease) for positive and negative OASIS images. Block type will be entered as the within subject factor and separate analyses will be conducted each with relevant EEG components/behavioral ratings as the outcome. The Tukey method will be used to correct for families of three estimates per analysis.

### Analytic Plan for Aim Three
Building upon the previous models, PA will be added as a mean-centered level-two predictor. 
A cross-level interaction will be analyzed between viewing condition and positive affectivity to evaluate whether the relationship between watching positive stimuli (relative to watching neutral stimuli) and EEG components of interest/behavioral ratings significantly vary as a function of positive affectivity. 
To assess whether savoring capacity plays a moderating role in affective neural processing of OASIS stimuli, savoring capacity will be added as a mean-centered level-two predictor. 
The dummy-coded level-one viewing condition variable will be altered so that the positive passive viewing condition will be the reference group. 
A cross-level interaction will be analyzed between viewing condition and savoring capacity to evaluate whether the
relationship between increasing emotional intensity in response to positive stimuli (relative to watching positive stimuli) and EEG components of interest/behaviora ratings amplitudes significantly vary as a function of savoring capacity.

## Power Analysis
Power Calculations were conducted using the G-power [@faulPowerFlexibleStatistical2007] software applications.
Power analyses focused on evaluating differences in LPP amplitudes between viewing conditions (repeated measures ANOVA). 
No prior research has successfully examined significant amplitude differences between watch and increase conditions for positive stimuli.
Therefore, estimates of LPP amplitude differences between watch and suppress conditions for negative stimuli were used from a
study conducted by Moser et al. (2006) to conduct the present power analysis.
Given an
N of 40, we will have 1.0 power to detect a large effect (f = .61; @cohenStatisticalPowerAnalysis1969) of viewing
conditions’ effect on LPP amplitudes. 
Furthermore, an N of 40 will provide .81 power to
detect a large effect [@cohenStatisticalPowerAnalysis1969] of the moderation analysis proposed in hypothesis 2b.
