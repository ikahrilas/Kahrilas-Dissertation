## DIFFERENCES IN NEURAL TIME COURSE OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EMOTION REACTIVITY AND REGULATION
Healthy emotion regulation abilities are integral to wellbeing [@grossEmergingFieldEmotion1998; @grossEmotionRegulationMental1995; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009; @sapolskyStressStressrelatedDisease2007].
Emotion regulation refers to psychological processes that influence an initial emotional response [@lewisAdvancesProblemsChallenges2010a], including modulation of positive and negative affective states [@koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009].
This also includes attenuating upsetting, or enhancing positive aspects, of a situation [@grossEmergingFieldEmotion1998].
Emotion regulation and reactivity are interrelated constructs. 
An individual’s ability to regulate emotions is predicated upon emotion reactivity, or how an individual experiences an initial baseline affective response to a stimulus, which spans feelings, behavioral manifestations, and bodily reactions [@grossEmotionRegulationConceptual2007]. 
Emotion regulation implies that a change has occurred from baseline reactivity to an affective stimulus.
Poor emotion regulation strategies are associated with a myriad of risks for poor health and wellbeing, including worsened social functioning [e.g., avoidance of close relationships, few positive relationships, and disinclination to share emotions with others; @grossAntecedentandResponsefocusedEmotion1998; @grossEmotionRegulationAffective2002; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009], as well as lower self-esteem and life satisfaction [@grossAntecedentandResponsefocusedEmotion1998; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009; @ochsnerRethinkingFeelingsFMRI2002].
Poor emotion regulation is also associated with bullying and victimization among youth [@walcottRelationDisinhibitionEmotion2004], physical ailments such as hypertension and coronary heart disease [@hintonMechanismsEfficacyCBT2009; @jorgensenElevatedBloodPressure1996], exacerbated cortisol reactivity to stressors [@wirtzLowSocialSupport2006], and impaired cognitive functioning [@keenanEmotionDysregulationRisk2000; @ochsnerRethinkingFeelingsFMRI2002].
Further, many types of psychopathology such as depression [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008a; @joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a], bipolar disorder [@townsendEmotionProcessingRegulation2012], and schizophrenia [@straussEmotionRegulationAbnormalities2013] involve dysfunctions in emotion regulation and/or reactivity. 

Disentangling emotion reactivity and regulation is complex [@joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a], and these two constructs share considerable temporal overlap in terms of affective chronometry [@davidsonReactivityRecoveryRegulation2018].
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a psychophysiological method that can be used to evaluate the chronometry of reactivity and regulation processes. 
In particular, event-related potentials (ERPs) facilitate assessment of neural responses to affective stimuli with millisecond temporal resolution [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
Thus the present study used EEG methods to investigate the temporal course of reactivity and regulation of visual affective stimuli in order to contribute to the development of more targeted psychological treatments and interventions designed to support positive health and wellbeing outcomes.

Previous psychophysiological research has typically focused on either the neural correlates of reactivity *or* regulation, within positive or negative valence task conditions or mood states, which has precluded researchers from identifying a comprehensive picture of the temporal course of reactivity and regulation in the context of both positive and negative valence.
Incorporating negative and positive images in emotion reactivity and regulation paradigms facilitates direct comparison of reactivity and regulation conditions across valenced stimuli.
Thus, in the present study, we implemented an experimental paradigm where participants were shown blocks of images of varying arousal (positive, negative, and neutral) with different regulation instructions (increasing/decreasing emotional intensity in response to images, or passively watching).
In the subsequent sections, we provide a brief overview of relevant ERP components, ranging from early to late components, that have been implicated in emotion reactivity and regulation. 
As explained in more detail in the method section, we implemented a PCA approach to identifying ERP components, and previous research on the neural correlates of reactivity and regulation contributed to informing our selection of components.

Many types of psychopathology are known to involve dysfunctions in emotion reactivity and regulation [e.g., @liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018; @moserNeuralMarkersPositive2014; @siltonRegulatingPositiveEmotions2020a; @weinbergDecreasedNeuralResponse2017; @weinbergDistinctAssociationsLow2018].
For example, depression is associated with attenuated emotional reactivity to affective stimuli [e.g., @fotiReducedElectrocorticalResponse2010; @weinbergDepressionReducedNeural2016] and ineffective regulation efforts that are marked by reduced recruitment of structures implicated in cognitive control and attention allocation [@pietrekNeuromagneticIndicationDysfunctional2012].
Identifying the temporal course of these constructs will contribute to the development of more targeted psychological treatments and interventions, such as informing depression treatment by focusing on reactivity to emotional stimuli (e.g., mindfulness-based interventions) and enhancing emotion regulation (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy to facilitate reappraisal). 

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a psychophysiological method that can be used for disentangling the chronometry of reactivity and regulation processes. 
In particular, event-related potentials (ERPs) facilitate assessment of neural responses to affective stimuli with millisecond temporal resolution [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
This is critical to evaluate the rapid processing of and dynamic processes that are characteristic of emotional reactivity and regulation [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008]. Thus, the present study used EEG methods to explore the time course of reactivity and regulation of positive and negative affective visual stimuli. 
Previous psychophysiological research has typically focused on either the neural correlates of reactivity *or* regulation, within positive or negative valence task conditions or mood states, which has precluded researchers from identifying a comprehensive picture of the temporal course of reactivity and regulation in the context of both positive and negative valence. 


<!-- While savoring is a trait-like measure of one's ability to regulate positive emotions, positive affectivity (PA) pertains to one's reactivity to positive emotions, or a trait-like disposition to recognize, attend to, and ultimately experience positive emotions [e.g., happiness, interest, energy, and self-assurance; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009]. -->
<!-- Understanding how individual differences modify the neural correlates of positive emotion reactivity/regulation may facilitate development of neuroscience-informed interventions for those with psychological problems marked by low levels of positive emotion (e.g., depression).  -->

<!-- ERP studies investigating emotion reactivity commonly incorporate both negatively- and positively-valenced stimuli.  -->
<!-- The same is not true of emotion regulation studies, where it is convention to investigate regulation conditions with only negative or positive images [e.g., @krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008; @moserElectrophysiologicalCorrelatesDecreasing2009]. -->

#### Early Visual ERP Components Associated with Affective Processing
The N170 and early posterior negativity (EPN) are early visual EEG components that are modulated by affective stimuli [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].
The N170 is a negative peak observed at bilateral occipito-temporal electrode sites, occurring approximately 170 ms following stimulus presentation [@blauFacespecificN170Component2007].
A network of posterior neural structures of the extrastriate visual cortex appear to contribute to the N170 [@haxbyDistributedHumanNeural2000]. 
These structures include the occipital/fusiform face areas and the superior temporal sulcus in the lateral temporal cortex [@haxbyDistributedHumanNeural2000].
However, precise identification of brain structures associated with N170 remains unclear, and it is likely that N170 is the product of concomitant activation across various brain regions that are dynamically recruited contingent upon the task at hand [@calderUnderstandingRecognitionFacial2005; @hoffmanDistinctRepresentationsEye2000].

The N170 has commonly been observed in response to facial stimuli and is thought to reflect rapid structural encoding of faces, with increased N170 amplitude associated with threat-related and positive facial expressions compared to neutral facial expressions [@blauFacespecificN170Component2007; @dasilvaDissociatingNeuralTime2016; @stockdaleInfluenceStimulusValence2020].
Some research indicates comparable N170 amplitude for positive and negative facial expressions, while other studies show enhanced N170 amplitude for negative compared to positive facial expressions [for a review, see @hinojosaN170SensitivityFacial2015; @stockdaleInfluenceStimulusValence2020].
Enhanced (i.e., more negative) N170 amplitude has also been observed in response to negatively-valenced complex affective images [i.e., IAPS; @bekhterevaAttentionalBiasAffective2015], albeit with a slightly later peak latency compared to face stimuli (160 - 200 ms for face stimuli and 200 - 240 ms for IAPS).
Limited, if any research, has studied patterns of N170 activity evoked by positive affective images (beyond facial expressions), and identifying the temporal course of early neural response to both positive and negative affective stimuli is important for advancing treatment and intervention for psychological disorders hallmarked by transdiagnostic dimensions of dysregulated emotion reactivity and regulation. 

While studies have generally shown that N170 is sensitive to valence rather than arousal, the EPN has been observed in response to emotionally arousing compared to neutral stimuli in the 200 - 300 ms window over bilateral occipital-parietal sites [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000; @schuppAttentionEmotionERP2003]. 
Potential neural generators of the EPN are located in the occipital cortex and may also include contributions from parietal regions [@wiensNonemotionalFeaturesSuppress2011].
Yoon et al. [-@yoonEnhancedEarlyPosterior2016] found that EPN amplitude in response to happy and fearful faces was augmented (i.e., enhanced negativity) compared to neutral faces in healthy control participants.
Individuals differences, including psychopathology symptoms also modulate the EPN. 
For example, individuals with anxiety disorders exhibited greater EPN amplitude in response to fearful compared to happy and neutral faces, suggesting that anxiety may specifically enhance response to fearful faces [@yoonEnhancedEarlyPosterior2016].
Other research has observed augmented EPN amplitude in response to pleasant compared to unpleasant complex emotional stimuli, suggesting a "pleasure bias" [@frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019].
EPN has been observed across a variety of different tasks, inter-stimulus intervals (ISI), and stimulus presentation durations [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008], leading researchers to surmise that EPN reflects relatively automatic processes observed even when processing resources are limited due to rapid presentation rates [@junghoferFleetingImagesNew2001; @schuppAttentionEmotionERP2003; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
This sensitivity to affective stimuli may index rapid affective amygdala processing of emotionally salient information [@ledouxEmotionCluesBrain1995; @morrisConsciousUnconsciousEmotional1998] and is also theorized to index selective attention where evaluation of image features is contingent upon affectively arousing perceptual characteristics for additional processing [@dolcosEventrelatedPotentialsEmotional2002; @schuppSelectiveProcessingBriefly2004].
Thus, highly arousal, rather than valence, may elicit augmented EPN amplitude.

Most of the research reviewed above involves passive viewing of affective stimuli (i.e., reactivity) and has not involved regulatory contexts. 
However, an emerging body of research indicates that N170 and EPN are modulated via implicit emotion regulation.
While explicit emotion regulation requires conscious effort (e.g., intentionally downregulating one's emotions in response to a negative stimuli), implicit emotion regulation is automatically evoked by stimuli and occurs unconsciously, or without awareness [e.g., presenting a valenced word prior to a stimulus of an incongruent arousal; @gyurakExplicitImplicitEmotion2011].
Herbert and colleagues [-@herbertNoFearNo2013] found that EPN signals were significantly attenuated during downregulation of emotional intensity in response to pictures of fearful faces.
Such effects were not found for downregulation of emotional intensity in response to happy faces [@herbertNoFearNo2013].
Another study analyzed N170 and EPN differences among participants with low and high trait anxiety in an implicit emotion regulation task in response to pictures of facial expressions [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018].
Findings illustrated that implicit emotion regulation processing led to more significant decreases in self report negative emotional intensity ratings, and that these decreases were correlated with enhanced N170 and EPN amplitude [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018].
Lastly, these findings were observed for participants with low trait anxiety but not high trait anxiety, suggesting deficits in implementing implicit emotion regulation strategies in individuals with anxiety [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018].
However, other research has shown that implicit emotion regulation modifies N170, but not EPN, implicating that implicit emotion regulation may be implemented in earlier perceptual stages of emotion processing rather than later selective attention stages [i.e., EPN & LPP; @wangTemporalCourseImplicit2017].
Since early ERP components are modified via emotion regulation efforts, these findings further blur the conceptual lines between reactivity and regulation and are in line with previous research showing that response to visual affective stimuli observed as early as 100 ms are influenced by individual differences [e.g., empathy; @stockdaleCoolCallousControl2017].
However, these findings fit well within the context of conceptualizing reactivity and regulation as a matter of altering motivational significance; though implicit emotion regulation occurs unconsciously, it still serves to manipulate significance of stimuli.
Given these inconsistent findings and the scarce research investigating the relationship between explicit reappraisal emotion regulation strategies (as utilized in our present study), no hypotheses were made regarding the relationship among regulation conditions (i.e., increasing/decreasing emotional intensity in response to positive/negative images) and N170/EPN. 

<!-- Of note, other research has supported the notion that the N170 specifically indexes structural encoding of facial features independent of emotional expression [e.g., @thierryControllingInterstimulusPerceptual2007] and that studies observing N170 modulation due to emotional expressions may be due to superimposed EPN activity [@relleckeEmotionEffectsN1702013]. -->
<!-- This suggests that neural sources for face- and emotion-related processes may be independent parallel processes [@bruceUnderstandingFaceRecognition1986; @relleckeEmotionEffectsN1702013]. -->
<!-- However, this notion is at odds with a meta-analysis conducted by Hinojosa and colleagues [-@hinojosaN170SensitivityFacial2015] that showed N170 sensitivity to facial expressions. -->
<!-- Thus, it may be that N170 and EPN may share common neural processes related to face and emotion processing, though research has generally established the former as more associated with face processing and the latter emotional processing. -->

<!-- To the author's knowledge, previous research has not investigated N170 in response to positively arousing complex visual stimuli. -->
<!-- This information may elucidate distinct neural time course patterns for positive and negative emotions that may inform treatment for psychological problems marked by dysregulated emotion reactivity and regulation. -->
<!-- Thus, it was hypothesized in the present study that highly arousing positive and negative affective images may elicit more negative N170 relative to neutral visual affective stimuli. -->

<!-- #### Individual Differences Modulate Early Visual Components -->
<!-- Though early components such as N170 and EPN have been conceptualized as relatively automatic processes, research suggests that they are influenced by individual differences. -->
<!-- For example, Stockdale and colleagues (2017) found that neural processing at 100 ms varies as a function of a modifiable individual difference (i.e., empathy). -->
<!-- Additionally, implicit regulatory effects on visual components varies based on one's trait anxiety [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018]. -->
<!-- Previous research has shown relationships between extraversion [a personality trait related to PA; @costaInfluenceExtraversionNeuroticism1980; @warrIndependencePositiveNegative1983; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009] and subcortical activity in response to positive stimuli [@canliAmygdalaResponseHappy2002; @canliFMRIStudyPersonality2001]. -->
<!-- The amygdala, which is implicated in Canli and colleagues' studies (2001, 2002), is also theorized to contribute to N170 and EPN [@vuilleumierDistantInfluencesAmygdala2004]. -->
<!-- Thus, EPN activity in response to positive vs. neutral images may be contingent upon PA. -->
<!-- In light of the conceptual overlap between reactivity and regulation and lack of research investigating explicit emotion regulation's effect on early visual components, no hypotheses were made regarding the relationship between N170/EPN, regulation conditions, and savoring capacity. -->

#### Slow Wave Components Associated with Affective Processing and Individual Differences
Research using EEG has implicated the LPP, a sustained positive slow wave observed starting as early as 300 ms following stimuli onset, as an established index of evaluative congruency and arousal [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
Research has consistently shown that LPP over the centroparietal cortex is augmented in response to unpleasant and pleasant compared to neutral images [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @dillonDissociationEventrelatedPotentials2006; @fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @hajcakTemporalDynamicsEmotion2007; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
LPP is most pronounced for images that are rated as highly arousing [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007].
LPP has been theorized to reflect activation of a brain network engaged in processing affective visual stimuli, including subcortical structures, particularly the amygdala [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003], which is corroborated by considerable input and output connections connecting the visual cortex to amygdaloid nuclei in primates [@amaralAnatomicalOrganizationPrimate1992].
Increased levels of self-reported arousal in response to stimuli yields augmented LPP amplitude [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000; @thiruchselvamTemporalDynamicsEmotion2011; @trittIdeologicalReactivityPolitical2016].
INSERT PRIMARY TAKE HOME MESSAGE HERE.

Enhanced LPP has been observed when participants described affective images in more negative (compared to neutral) terms [@fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008] and when participants were instructed to evaluate images in affective (compared to non-affective) conditions [@hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006].
Other research has shown reduced LPP when participants suppressed emotional intensity in response to viewing highly arousing affective images [e.g., @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
However, research has not reliably demonstrated that LPP is enhanced when participants are instructed to enhance their emotional intensity in response to negative [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] and positive [@krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008] affective stimuli.
Methodological factors might be contributing to these findings, such as inconsistent stimulus presentation durations, utilization of non-blocked vs. blocked designs, and different offline filter settings.
LPP is theorized to be indicative of an interaction between amygdala and cognitive control structures [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] as indicated by LPP amplitude being sensitive to reappraisal efforts [e.g., reduced LPP amplitude in response to reappraising negative visual stimuli; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
Furthermore, savoring capacity is positively associated with affect intensity and is indicative of one’s ability to bolster positive emotion [@bryantSavoringBeliefsInventory2003a].
This is corroborated by a recent study conducted by Wilson and MacNamara [-@wilsonSavorMomentWillful2021], that found increases in centroparietal LPP with a savoring paradigm.
More specifically, increases in LPP were observed when participants were asked to savor a positive image compared to just viewing positive images.
Therefore, higher self-report ratings of one’s capacity to savor were expected to moderate the relationship between LPP and increased emotional intensity in response to positive stimuli.

Research has indicated enhanced frontal LPP as an index of increased cognitive effort [@bernatEffectsInstructedEmotion2011; @moserNeuralMarkersPositive2014; @shafirEmotionalIntensityInfluences2015]. 
Moser et al. (2014) and Shafir et al. (2015) both observed augmented frontal LPP at Fz electrode sites when positively reappraising relative to passively watching negative images in the 800 ms - 1100 ms time window. 
Bernat and colleagues (2011) also observed enhanced right frontal LPP in response to suppression and enhancement conditions in response to negative stimuli. 
In the context of emotion regulation, frontal LPP is only observed while using positive reappraisal strategies rather than distraction [@shafirEmotionalIntensityInfluences2015].
In other words, frontal LPP appears to be contingent upon cognitive exertion, which is further supported by research observing recruitment of frontal neural structures (PFC and ACC) during control efforts [@millerIntegrativeTheoryPrefrontal2001; @ochsnerBetterWorseNeural2004], particularly control efforts that are implemented during emotion regulation (CITATION HERE).
With regard to positive images, Wilson and MacNamara (2021) found increased frontal LPP in response to passively viewing positive images compared to neutral images, as well as savoring (i.e., upregulating) positive and neutral images. Thus, we expected to observed enhanced frontal LPP during regulation conditions relative to passive watch conditions (i.e., increasing/decreasing compared to passively watching for both positive and negative stimuli) in the present study. We also predicted that frontal LPP would vary between passive watch conditions (i.e., passively viewing positive and negative versus neutral images).

#### Disentangling overlapping neural processes implicated in reactivity and regulation: A principal components approach
Nearly all of the ERP research reviewed above involved submitting windowed averages, or area measures to statistical analyses, which is a common practice in ERP research. 
However, this method may be inadequate in dealing with the thorny issue of components that overlap temporally [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978; @fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009], which is of primary consideration in this present study since a primary aim of this study is to investigate the *temporal* courses associated with emotion reactivity and regulation
The method of submitting windowed averages, or area measures, to statistical analyses is common practice in ERP research. 
However, this method is inadequate in dealing with the thorny issue of overlapping components [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978].
Indeed, there is speculation that N170 modulation due to emotional expressions may be due to superimposed EPN activity [@relleckeEmotionEffectsN1702013].
Similarly, LPP may overlap with P3, a parietally maximal component peaking in the 300-400 ms window that is sensitive to task relevant and motivationally significant stimuli [@polichCognitiveBiologicalDeterminants1995], and even later portions of EPN [@schuppSelectiveProcessingBriefly2004].
To address this issue, we utilized an exploratory temporal principal components analysis (PCA) to better isolate distinct ERP components across time.
PCA is a dimension reduction technique that identifies a new set of variables that are linear combinations of the original variables.
In the context of ERPs, these new variables represent latent components that may not be apparent by visually inspecting ERP averages.
For example, if there were two temporally overlapping ERP components with equal magnitude but opposite directionality (positive and negative), the two components would negate each other and not be observable via inspection of grand average ERPs.
Temporal PCA, on the other hand, would theoretically be able to retain these components provided that the experimental paradigm reliably produces them.

<!-- ## Self-Report Ratings -->
<!-- In addition to EEG components, research has shown that affective visual stimuli are associated with increased arousal and arousal self-report ratings [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008]. -->
<!-- Thus, we hypothesized that passively viewing negative and positive images compared to neutral images would result in heightened arousal ratings, as well as decreased (for negative images) and increase (for positive images) arousal ratings. -->
<!-- Further, we expected that regulation conditions would result in behavioral ratings consistent with the regulatory goal. -->
<!-- Neural affective picture processing research has demonstrated a reduction in self-report ratings of arousal and arousal when participants are tasked with reappraising negative visual stimuli [e.g., @thiruchselvamTemporalDynamicsEmotion2011]. -->
<!-- We predicted that arousal ratings would be heightened for increase conditions and lowered for decrease conditions.  -->
<!-- We further predicted that arousal ratings would be more neutral during decrease conditions and more negative when increasing emotional intensity in response to negative images and more positive when increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images relative to passive watch conditions, respectively. -->
<!-- Last, trait measures of PA and savoring capacity are associated with heightened arousal and more positive affect in response to reacting to and upregulating positive emotion, respectively [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009]. -->
<!-- Thus, it was hypothesized that the difference in behavioral/arousal ratings between passively watching positive vs. neutral images would be positively moderated by PA and the difference in behavioral/arousal ratings between increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images vs. passively watching positive images would be positively moderated by savoring capacity. -->

<!-- ### Facilitating Reproducibility with Open Access Stimuli -->
<!-- Much of the aforementioned research has utilized the International Affective Picture System [IAPS; @langInternationalAffectivePicture2008]. -->
<!-- The IAPS is a set of color pictures that span a range of semantic categories, and arousal/arousal ratings derived from a normative sample are provided for each image. -->
<!-- The IAPS was developed to provide a standardized stimulus set of emotional images to facilitate the comparison of results across different studies and enhance replication across research groups [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007]. -->
<!-- IAPS images are rated with respect to arousal (negative-to-positive) and arousal (low-to-high) on a nine-point visual analogue scale. -->
<!-- The IAPS has been used in a number of studies investigating neural correlates of affective processing and emotion regulation [e.g., @fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @kimNeuralCorrelatesPositive2007; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003]. -->
<!-- The copyright agreement that accompanies the IAPS mandates that users cannot place any of the images on computer-accessible websites. -->
<!-- This poses considerable restraint on increasing reliance on online samples in behavioral research that make data collection from large and diverse samples faster, less costly, and more efficient [@berinskyEvaluatingOnlineLabor2012; @buhrmesterAmazonMechanicalTurk2011; @krautPsychologicalResearchOnline2004; @masonConductingBehavioralResearch2012; @paolacciRunningExperimentsAmazon2010]. -->
<!-- Thus, there is an increasing demand for images with standardized arousal and arousal ratings for behavioral researchers to use in online contexts. -->
<!-- Kurdi, Lazano, and Banaji [-@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] heeded this call with the Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS). -->
<!-- The OASIS is a collection of 900 high quality images collected from open-access online sources depicting a range of categories (people, animals, objects, & scenes). -->
<!-- The OASIS was normed on arousal and arousal ratings collected from a diverse sample recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017]. -->
<!-- To facilitate experimental control in the selection of stimuli and facilitating comparison of results and replication across different studies using this new image set, the present study utilized OASIS stimuli in lieu of the IAPS. -->

### The Present Study
The present study utilized an experimental paradigm consisting of seven blocks of images using 120 different OASIS stimuli. 40 images were highly arousing positive images, 40 images were highly-arousing negative images, and 40 were neutral. 
Participants were tasked with increasing or decreasing emotional intensity in response to (i.e., upregulating or downregulating) positive and negative images, as well as passively watching them. 
Participants also passively viewed the block of 40 neutral images.
Following each block of images, participants were asked to rate on a seven-point scale how positive or negative they feel (arousal), the intensity of the emotion they feel (arousal), as well as how difficult the regulation task was (difficulty).
The present study had two primary objectives.
The first objective of the proposed study was to replicate previous research using the IAPS with the OASIS.
We hypothesized that a) highly arousing positive compared to neutral OASIS stimuli would be associated with enhanced ERP components (N170, EPN, LPP) and self-report ratings (greater arousal, more positive arousal ratings) and b) highly arousing negative compared to neutral OASIS stimuli would be associated with enhanced ERP components (N170, EPN, LPP) and self-report ratings (greater arousal and more negative arousal ratings).
Related, we hypothesized that LPP amplitude would be modulated in a manner congruent with the regulatory goal.
More specifically, reduction of LPP amplitude would be observed in decrease conditions compared to passive watch conditions, and increased LPP amplitude would be observed in increase conditions compared to passive watch conditions.
Additionally, we predicted that frontal LPP amplitude would be increased for all regulation conditions (increase and decrease), though not modulated for passive watch conditions.
The second objective was to examine the relation between personality traits pertaining to positive emotion and EEG components/self-report ratings.
We predicted that a) PA would moderate the relationship between watching positive images and LPP as well as self-report ratings (increased arousal and more positive arousal ratings) and b) savoring capacity would moderate the relationship between increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images and LPP amplitude as well as self-report ratings (increased arousal and more positive arousal-ratings). 

Hypotheses pertaining to modulation of LPP amplitude in response to passively viewing OASIS images and personality traits interacting with LPP amplitude and PA/savoring capacity were preregistered (link: [https://osf.io/p5ba9/](https://osf.io/p5ba9/)).
As we continued to read the explore the scientific literature about reactivity and regulation, we decided to expand our analyses to the other components (N170, EPN) in order to characterize the broader temporal cascade of affective processing.
Thus, these unregistered analyses should be considered exploratory and interpreted with caution.
Further, the decision to implement principal components analysis (PCA) was made following preregistration to more effectively isolate ERPs for subsequent statistical analyses.
All data and R code are availabe on the Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/p5ba9/](https://osf.io/p5ba9/).

## Method 
### Participants
54 participants were recruited for the study, two of which were excluded due to missing EEG or questionnaire data (*n* = 29 women, *n* = 2 non-binary).
Participants ranged in age from 18-29 (*M* = 19.84 years, *SD* = 1.95).
The sample was 70.6% Caucasian, 17.6% Asian, 2.0% Black or African American, and 7.8% multiracial (2.0% declined to answer); 9.8% reported that they were Hispanic/Latino and 90.2% were not Hispanic/Latino.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and informed consent was provided to all participants prior to beginning the experiment.

### Materials and Procedure
#### Questionnaire Measures
Participants were asked to complete the trait Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) to assess for PA ($\omega = .89$) and NA ($\omega = .89$).
Participants also completed the Savoring Beliefs Inventory (SBI; Bryant, 2009).
The SBI measures the perception of one’s ability to feel pleasure through anticipating positive outcomes ($\omega = .88$), savoring positive moments ($\omega = .85$), and reminiscing about past positive events ($\omega = .86$; Bryant, 2009).
Only the momentary savoring subscale was used in the following moderation analyses, as this temporal domain was most relevant to the present hypotheses and experimental paradigm.

#### Emotion Task Paradigm
64-channel high-density electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded while participants viewed seven blocks of 40 images (280 total trials).
The study used 120 different Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS) images [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
40 of the images were positive, 40 were neutral, and 40 were negative.
Previous research has shown that 40 trials is sufficient to evoke a reliable LPP component [@fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
The mean normative arousal ratings (on a scale of one to seven) were 5.71, 4.09, and 2.18 for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.
The mean normative arousal ratings (on a scale of one to seven) were 4.46, 1.99, and 4.52, for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.

Each block represented an experimental regulation condition: increase (positive/negative), decrease (positive/negative), and watch (positive/negative/neutral).
During the increase condition, participants were instructed to appraise the picture in a way that will intensify the emotion that is elicited by looking at it.
During the decrease condition, participants were asked to reduce the intensity of the emotion that is elicited by looking at the picture.
When prompted to watch, participants were asked to view the picture as they would naturally.
The passive “watch” blocks served as baseline conditions for LPP component analyses [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
A block design was selected for the proposed study because arousing images outnumber the neutral images two-to-one.
The relatively rare neutral stimuli may produce a P3 if intermixed with valenced stimuli in the same block [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000]. Additionally, LPP signal is increased for stimuli that are perceived as incongruent within a given affective context.
Thus, a neutral stimulus displayed in a series of emotional stimuli would likely evoke an enhanced LPP activity, thus decreasing effect size [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000].
Further, a block design paradigm may better emulate one's natural environment, as stimuli of congruent arousal are typically encountered in clusters rather than isolation [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].
Research comparing intermixed and block designs for LPP and EPN have shown comparable findings between the two approaches [@pastorAffectivePicturePerception2008; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].

First, participants completed three practice trials that consisted of 10 images not used during the actual task [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
Participants were instructed to increase or decrease emotional arousal in response to a mixture of positive and negative images, respectively.
Participants were also asked to watch a third practice trial comprised of positive, negative, and neutral images.
Stimuli were presented in random order within each block.
Prior to each practice trial, participants were provided with instructions on how to regulate (increase/decrease) their affective response to the stimuli, or to simply view the stimuli [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
Participants were shown which regulation strategy to engage in (increase, decrease, or watch) at the start of each experimental block.
Once the participant was ready, an OASIS stimulus appeared for 2000 ms [@fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008].
Following stimulus offset, a blank screen appeared for 500 ms followed by a fixation cross for 1500 ms (± 250 ms) for a total ISI of 1750 - 2250 ms (see Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image-1) for a visual depiction of the experimental paradigm used in the present study).
This interval is identical to other studies utilizing the IAPS and investigating LPP [@dunningSeeNoEvil2009; @hajcakMotivatedControlledAttention2009].
Stimuli within each block were presented in random order.
Each block was separated by a break and presented in pseudo-random order, such that no arousal (i.e., positive or negative) nor regulation (i.e., increase, decrease, or watch) condition were presented consecutively.
After each experimental block, arousal and arousal ratings were collected using a seven-point likert scale and the same instructions used in Kurdi, Lozano, and Banaji’s [-@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] norming study of the OASIS stimuli set.
Furthermore, difficulty ratings on a seven-point likert scale were also obtained.

### Apparatus and Physiological Recording
Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) was measured while participants completed an emotion regulation task (Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image-1)).
Participants were seated in a comfortable chair, approximately 24 inches from a 24-inch LCD monitor in a quiet, dimly lit room.
Participants were monitored by a task administrator in a nearby room and received task instructions by intercom.
EEG data were recorded using a Biosemi Active2 EEG system.
A custom-designed Falk Minow 64-channel cap with equidistantly spaced BioSemi active Ag and AgCl electrodes was used for data collection.
CMS/DRL was placed near the vertex, and two electrodes were located on the mastoid bones.
After placement of the electrode cap, electrode positions were digitized.
An additional electrode was placed on the inferior edge of the orbit of each eye to monitor vertical eye movements; nearby electrodes in the cap (lateral to each eye) monitored horizontal eye movements.
Data were recorded with a band pass of 0 – 104 Hz at a sampling rate of 512 Hz.

The following EEG data processing steps were implemented in Brain Electrical Source Analysis software [BESA, Version 7; @schergBESABrainElectric1990].
Following the adaptive artifact correction method [@illeArtifactCorrectionOngoing2002], ocular artifacts were corrected using a spatial PCA filter.
EEG data were re-referenced to the [@hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006]  average reference of all electrodes for analyses and digitally filtered with 0.01 Hz high-pass and 30 Hz low-pass filters with a cutoff attenuation of 12 dB/octave.
EEG data were re-referenced to the average activity of all electrodes.
While it is convention to re-reference data to average activity of the mastoids for LPP, a covariance matrix was utilized in the PCA, which is inherently mean corrected [@dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012].
Thus, minimal effects would be expected as a function of referencing scheme for temporal PCA (though this is not the case for spatial PCAj; see @dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012).
Muscle activity and other artifacts were corrected through implementing an algorithmic scan of continuous EEG data in BESA (fixed threshold criteria: amplitude > 120 uV; gradient > 75 uV, low signal <.01 uV).
Data were baseline-adjusted by subtracting the average activity for 200 milliseconds [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] before stimulus onset.

To discriminate among temporal sources of variance (i.e., ERP components) in the time course of ERPs, ERP averages were submitted to a temporal PCA to derive linear combinations of data that distinguish activity across time points. 
A temporal PCA was performed using the Psych package [@revellePsychProceduresPsychological2020] in R version 4.0.3 [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2020] with a covariance matrix.
A covariance matrix was used to retain the original units of measurement (i.e., voltage) for the average ERPs for each time point [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978].
The temporal PCA used all time points (-200 ms - 2000 ms) as variables and all 55 participants, seven blocks, and 66 recording sites as observations, yielding linear combinations of time points and "temporal" factors [@dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012].
To determine the number of components to retain for rotation, a parallel analysis [@hornRationaleTestNumber1965] was performed on the resultant Scree plot.
The parallel analysis creates Scree plots of the actual and simulated fully random data to determine the number of components that explain more variance than if only chance alone were acting. 
Based on the parallel analysis, 22 components were retained for rotation. 
An Promax rotation was then used on the 22 components because it does not impose orthogonality, and simulation studies suggest that Promax is most effective for temporal PCA [@dienERPPCAToolkit2010; @dienEvaluationPCAICA2007].
The time course of each of the 22 components was inspected by plotting the covariance loadings along each time point. 
Given the a priori nature of the ERP components of interest, those PCA components with covariance loadings in time windows that fit descriptions of LPP and early visual components (e.g., N170, EPN) were retained for further analyses.
Spatial information is retained in PCA; the topography of each factor is encoded in the mean amplitude of factor scores at each recording site [@dienAddressingMisallocationVariance1998].
Thus, scalp topographies of each component for each condition was inspected to determine correspondence of components and ERP components of interest.
Of note, portions of waveforms represented by a given PCA component can be reproduced by multiplying covariance loadings by observations' factor scores [@dienAddressingMisallocationVariance1998]. 
Five components were retained for statistical analyses based inspection of topographic plots and ERP waveforms.
Two of the retained components represented LPP-like components that have positive peaks at 381 ms and 740 ms with the former demonstrating activity at PO7 and PO8 electrode sites and the latter at PO7, PO8, PO3, PO4, P1, P2, P5/P3, P6/P4 and Pz electrode sites. 
Three components represented early visual components with positive peaks at 124 ms, 162 ms, and 259 ms with activity at PO7 and PO8 electrodes sites.
While no a priori hypotheses were made regarding ERP components occurring as early as 124 ms, we decided to retain the component for exploratory analyses.
While the time course of the 162 ms component corresponded to N170, the positive directionality of the waveform did not.
Two components with temporal loading peaks 259 ms were retained: a positive component noted earlier and a negative component at CPz and Pz electrodes sites, which represents EPN.
No frontal LPP component was identified.

<!-- LPP activity was calculated as the average activity in the 400 – 800 ms window at the Pz electrode site. -->
<!-- Adaptive means for N170 and EPN were computed separately to account for peak latency variability among participants. N170 was defined as the minimum mean-peak amplitude (average amplitude across +/- 15 ms around the peak) between 130 - 200 ms post-stimulus at PO7 and PO8 electrode sites. The EPN was defined as the minimum mean-peak amplitude (average amplitude across +/- 25 ms around the peak) detected between 225 to 325 ms post-stimulus at PO7 and PO8 electrode sites. -->
<!-- Scoring windows and electrode sites were similar to other studies investigating LPP, EPN, and N170 [e.g., @frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @thomEmotionalScenesElicit2014]. -->
The experiment was computer-administered using E-Prime 2.0 software [@schneiderEPrimeUserGuide2002] in order to manipulate the timing and presentation of stimuli.
All stimuli were presented in color and occupied the entirety of the 21-inch monitor.
The viewing distance was approximately 24 in. and occupied 25° of the vertical visual angle and 30° horizontally (Cuthbert et al., 2000; Hajcak & Nieuwenhuis, 2006).

## Results
```{r rm-ANOVA, message = FALSE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
load("data/paper_two/analyses/2021-03-01_repeated_measures_ANOVA_analysis-data.RData")
```
Analyses were run in R version 4.0.3 [@R-base].
Multilevel modeling (MLM) analyses were conducted using the lme4 package [@batesFittingLinearMixedeffects2015].
All linear mixed models were estimated using REML with participants included as random intercepts.
Model assumptions were checked via visual inspection of diagnostic plots (i.e., residual, QQ, scale-location, and residuals vs. leverage) generated with the performance package [@ludeckePerformanceAssessmentRegression2019].
<!-- Correlations among key psychological and demographic variables (see Table \@ref(tab:corr-table)) indicated significant associations ranging from small to large in effect size. -->
<!-- Descriptive statistics for each of the retained components from the temporal PCA and participant ratings (arousal, arousal, and difficulty) were calculated for each of the experimental blocks (see Table \@ref(tab:descriptives-by-block)). -->

Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to probe for significant deviations from the average activity of each component and behavioral rating as a function of experimental block.
Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were implemented to account for significant departures from sphericity as tested by Mauchly's test for sphericity.
Significant variation among experimental image blocks were found for the 124 ms component (`r rc5_results`), 162 ms component (`r rc11_results`), negative 259 component (`r neg_rc12_results`), positive 259 component (`r pos_rc12_results`), 381 ms component (`r pos_rc2_results`), and 740 ms component (`r pos_rc3_results`). 
Further, significant variation was examined with valence ratings (`r val_results`), arousal ratings (`r ar_results`), and difficulty ratings (`r diff_results`).

Follow up pairwise *t* tests were conducted using the emmeans package [@lenthEmmeansEstimatedMarginal2020] among passive watch and regulation conditions for PCA EEG components and behavioral ratings.
Findings for EEG components are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:contrast-plot)
More detailed statistical findings for each comparison are provided in Appendix A of the supplementary materials.
As noted earlier, the top row of topographic plots represents the average activity collapsed across all blocks for the time window of maximal activity as suggested by inspection of PCA covariance loadings.
The second row of topographic plots represent the average activity across the entire -200 to 2000 ms time window for each PCA component collapsed across all blocks.
Differences among blocks are illustrated with box-and-whisker/violin plots below the topographic plots.
The width of the violin plots corresponds to the number of cases, or density, with that level of the dependent variable.
Thus, they can largely be interpreted as one would a histogram, excepted rotated 90 degrees and symmetrical.
Regarding the box-and-whisker plots, the area between the lower and upper hinges correspond to the interquartile range (the 25th and 75th percentiles). 
The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the hinge. 
The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 times the interquartile range of the hinge. 
Data beyond the end of the whiskers are are plotted individually as dots.
<!-- which are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:pairwise-watch-comparison-table) and Table \@ref(tab:pairwise-reg-comparison-table), respectively. -->
<!-- Effect sizes were interpreted using Funder's [-@funderEvaluatingEffectSize2019] recommendations. -->
<!-- Topographical plots and average ERP waveforms for each component of interest were also created (see Figures \@ref(fig:LPP-watch-topos), \@ref(fig:LPP-reg-topos), \@ref(fig:EPN-N170-watch-topos), \@ref(fig:EPN-N170-pos-topos), \@ref(fig:EPN-N170-neg-topos), \@ref(fig:front-LPP-watch-topos), & \@ref(fig:front-LPP-reg-topos)). -->
Effect sizes are interpreted in accordance with Cohen's guidelines [@cohenStatisticalPowerAnalysis1988a].
Significant differences among all three passive watch conditions first emerged at the 162 ms component, with medium and small differences in negative versus neutral and positive versus neutral contrasts, respectively.  
There was also a small sized effect between negative and positive images, with negative images eliciting larger 162 ms component amplitude.
A similar pattern was observed with the 381 ms and 740 ms components with larger effects; there were large differences between negative and neutral watch conditions and medium differences between positive and neutral watch conditions.
Regarding negative watch and positive watch conditions, there was a small difference with the 381 ms component and a medium difference with the 740 ms component.
In both cases, negative images had larger amplitudes.
Medium sized significant differences were noted between negative and neutral watch conditions for the negative and positive 259 ms components.
No significant differences were observed for positive versus neutral watch conditions with the 259 ms components.
There was an additional small significant difference between the positive and negative passive watch conditions for the negative 259 ms component; the negative condition exhibited more negative amplitudes compared to the positive condition.

Regarding comparisons among regulation conditions, there were small significant difference between the positive increase and positive watch conditions for the negative 259 ms (positive increase < positive watch) and 381 ms components (positive increase > positive watch). 
There were also small differences between the positive increase and positive decrease conditions for the negative 259 ms, positive 381 ms, and positive 740 ms components; the positive increase conditions elicited more negative amplitude in the negative 259 ms component and more positive amplitude for the 381 ms and 740 ms components.
Small significant differences were noted between the negative increase and negative watch conditions for the 124 ms component (negative increase < negative watch) and negative 259 ms component (negative increase > negative watch).
Comparisons among increase conditions as well as decrease conditions were also performed.
A small significant difference was found between the negative and positive increase conditions for the negative 259 ms component; the negative increase condition elicited more negative amplitude. 
A difference in the same direction was found for negative and positive decrease conditions, except with a medium-sized effect.
Another small difference was found between the negative and positive increase conditions for the positive 259 ms component, with the positive increase condition eliciting more positive amplitude compared to the negative increase condition.
A small significant difference was observed between the negative and positive decrease conditions for the 381 ms component, with larger amplitude associated with the negative decrease condition.
Finally, with the 740 ms component as the outcome, the negative increase and decrease elicited greater amplitude than their positive counterparts, with small- and medium-sized effects, respectively.

The second objective was to examine the relationship between personality traits pertaining to positive emotion (i.e., PA and momentary savoring capacity) and relevant EEG components.
MLM with REML variance components covariance matrices to estimate random intercepts for each participant was used to test if the relationship between EEG components and passively viewing positive images versus neutral images varied as a function of trait positive affect.
Satterthwaite's method was used to approximate *F* test denominator degrees of freedom and *t* test degrees of freedom for all analyses.
Dummy-coded block (within subjects: neutral watch block as reference level) and mean-centered trait positive affect (between subjects) variables were included in the omnibus model.
An interaction term between block and trait positive affect variables was added to probe for a conditional relationship between block and each PCA component as a function of trait positive affect.
Results did not indicate a significant interaction between viewing condition and PA in predicting any of the PCA components (124 ms component: $b$ = `r rc5_pa_beta`, $SE$ = `r rc5_pa_se`, $t$(`r rc5_pa_df`) = `r rc5_pa_t`, $p$ `r rc5_pa_p`; 162 ms component: $b$ = `r rc11_pa_beta`, $SE$ = `r rc11_pa_se`, $t$(`r rc11_pa_df`) = `r rc11_pa_t`, $p$ `r rc11_pa_p`); negative 259 ms component: $b$ = `r rc12_pa_beta`, $SE$ = `r rc12_pa_se`, $t$(`r rc12_pa_df`) = `r rc12_pa_t`, $p$ `r rc12_pa_p`; positive 259 component: $b$ = `r pos_RC12_pa_beta`, $SE$ = `r pos_RC12_pa_se`, $t$(`r pos_RC12_pa_df`) = `r pos_RC12_pa_t`, $p$ `r pos_RC12_pa_p`; 381 ms component: $b$ = `r rc2_pa_beta`, $SE$ = `r rc2_pa_se`, $t$(`r rc2_pa_df`) = `r rc2_pa_t`, $p$ `r rc2_pa_p`; 740 ms component: $b$ = `r rc3_pa_beta`, $SE$ = `r rc3_pa_se`, $t$(`r rc3_pa_df`) = `r rc3_pa_t`, $p$ `r rc3_pa_p`).
Exploratory moderation analyses were also run with arousal and valence ratings as the dependent variable.
Results did not indicate a significant interaction between viewing condition and PA in predicting arousal ratings ($b$ = `r ar_pa_beta`, $\beta$ = `r ar_pa_std_beta`, $SE$ = `r ar_pa_se`, $t$(`r ar_pa_df`) = `r ar_pa_t`, $p$ `r ar_pa_p`), but indicated a small interaction effect in predicting arousal ratings ($b$ = `r val_pa_beta`, $\beta$ = `r val_pa_std_beta`, $SE$ = `r val_pa_se`, $t$(`r val_pa_df`) = `r val_pa_t`, $p$ `r val_pa_p`), such that greater levels of positive affectivity were associated with more positive arousal ratings after passively viewing positive images compared to neutral images.

To test if the relationship between PCA components/behavioral ratings and increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images versus passively watching positive images varied as a function of momentary savoring capacity, dummy-coded block (within subjects: positive watch block as reference level), and mean-centered savoring the moment (between subjects) variables were included in the omnibus model.
An interaction term between block and momentary savoring capacity variables was added to probe for a conditional relationship between block and PCA component as a function of savoring capacity.
Results did not indicate a significant interaction between viewing condition and savoring in predicting any of the PCA components (124 ms component: $b$ = `r RC5_stm_mod_beta`, $SE$ = `r RC5_stm_mod_se`, $t$(`r RC5_stm_mod_df`) = `r RC5_stm_mod_t`, $p$ `r RC5_stm_mod_p`; 162 ms component: $b$ = `r RC11_stm_mod_beta`, $SE$ = `r RC11_stm_mod_se`, $t$(`r RC11_stm_mod_df`) = `r RC11_stm_mod_t`, $p$ `r RC11_stm_mod_p`); negative 259 ms component: $b$ = `r RC12_stm_mod_beta`, $SE$ = `r RC12_stm_mod_se`, $t$(`r RC12_stm_mod_df`) = `r RC12_stm_mod_t`, $p$ `r RC12_stm_mod_p`; positive 259 component: $b$ = `r pos_RC12_stm_mod_beta`, $SE$ = `r pos_RC12_stm_mod_se`, $t$(`r pos_RC12_stm_mod_df`) = `r pos_RC12_stm_mod_t`, $p$ `r pos_RC12_stm_mod_p`; 381 ms component: $b$ = `r RC2_stm_mod_beta`, $SE$ = `r RC2_stm_mod_se`, $t$(`r RC2_stm_mod_df`) = `r RC2_stm_mod_t`, $p$ `r RC2_stm_mod_p`; 740 ms component: $b$ = `r RC3_stm_mod_beta`, $SE$ = `r RC3_stm_mod_se`, $t$(`r RC3_stm_mod_df`) = `r RC3_stm_mod_t`, $p$ `r RC3_stm_mod_p`).
Null findings were also found for behavioral ratings (arousal: $b$ = `r ar_stm_beta`, $\beta$ = `r ar_stm_std_beta`, $SE$ = `r ar_stm_se`, $t$(`r ar_stm_df`) = `r ar_stm_t`, $p$ `r ar_stm_p`, valence: $b$ = `r val_stm_beta`, $\beta$ = `r val_stm_std_beta`, $SE$ = `r val_stm_se`, $t$(`r val_stm_df`) = `r val_stm_t`, $p$ `r val_stm_p`).

## DISCUSSION
The present study had several aims: 1) to explore the OASIS as an alternative to the IAPS in psychophysiological research, 2) the neural time course of positive and negative emotion reactivity and regulation, and 3) how personality traits pertaining to positive emotions moderated the relation among regulatory goal and ERP components.
This research will help introduce more up-to-date and open access materials in affective neuroscience research and devise neuroscience-informed clinical interventions to enhance wellbeing.
Of note, our initial hypotheses included ERP components (i.e., N170 and frontal LPP) that were not retained in our temporal PCA. 
It may be that our block design paradigm or use of complex affective stimuli failed to capture these components.

In partial support of hypotheses in aim one of our study,  passively viewing positive and negative OASIS stimuli elicited augmented amplitude compared to neutral images across both LPP components and a positive component with a 162 ms peak.
Indeed, the earliest component retained from the PCA to demonstrate a valence effect for both negative and positive images occurred at 162 ms with negative images eliciting greater amplitude compared to positive images.
Highly arousing positive and negative images eliciting enhanced LPP is a common finding in research investigating the neural time course of affective processing with the IAPS [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @hajcakMotivatedControlledAttention2009; @hajcakNeuralResponseEmotional2007; @krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000; @trittIdeologicalReactivityPolitical2016].
It is also largely consistent with past research examining emotion reactivity with PCA [e.g., @fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009].
Smaller effects were found for positive images compared to negative images for LPP, which is consistent with previous literature [@fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009; @frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019].
Of note, these LPP findings are somewhat at odds with a 2012 study by Liu and colleagues [-@liuNeuralSubstrateLate2012] that found comparable effect sizes between positive and negative stimuli.
Differences between the present study and Liu et al. (2012) may be attributed to different high-pass filters (.01 Hz versus .1 Hz), experimental paradigms (block vs. randomized design), and use of PCA vs. averaging of time windows. 
Future researchers should be mindful of these factors as to facilitate replicability of results.

Enhanced EPN was observed for negative, but not positive, images relative to neutral images.
Further, the EPN for negative images was enhanced compared to the positive condition, which contradict a supposed "pleasure bias" in EPN, which suggests that positive complex images elicit augmented amplitude compared to negative images [@frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019].
One possible explanation for this discrepancy is our use of PCA, which addresses the issue of overlapping waveforms - a problem that windowed averages are vulnerable to [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978].
Further, we observed differences among all passive watch blocks with arousal and valence ratings.
More specifically, passively viewing negative images was associated with arousal scores that were significantly lower than neutral images, and passively viewing positive images was associated with arousal scores that were significantly higher than neutral images.
This suggests that the passive viewing conditions were successful in producing state mood manipulations.
and negatively-arousing stimuli may have stronger manipulations of emotion than positively-arousing stimuli.
These results also insinuate that the 162 ms component and both LPP components best map onto the valence and arousal constructs within passive watch conditions.
While positive and negative image sets were matched on average arousal and arousal ratings, pornographic images were omitted, which are commonly rated as highly arousing positive images [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007:1; @kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] and used in other studies investigating neural time course of affective processing with positive images [e.g., @hajcakTemporalDynamicsEmotion2007; @liuNeuralSubstrateLate2012].
Thus, the omission of these images may be contributing to discrepant findings in the present study compared to others.
<!-- Notably, behavioral ratings correlated with LPP activity, reflecting a relation among state manipulations of arousal and arousal in and parietal cortical activity. -->
Overall, these findings lend support to the OASIS image set being used in subsequent psychophysiological studies investigating the neural time course of affective processing.
The OASIS also has several advantages over the IAPS; it is up-to-date, spans a number of semantic categories, and is open access [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].

We found partial support for our hypotheses that there will be modulations in LPP and behavioral ratings in regulation blocks for LPP and behavioral ratings.
Regulation effects were found in the 381 ms LPP-like component for the positive increase condition compared to the positive watch and decrease conditions.
This contrasts with previous literature reporting null findings [@krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008; @moserElectrophysiologicalCorrelatesDecreasing2009], which was attributed to a theorized ceiling effect that results from automatic capture of attentional resources by motivationally relevant stimuli.
However, no positive increase effect was observed for the 740 ms LPP component, though the positive increase condition did elicit an augmented amplitude when compared with the positive decrease condition.
The hypothesis the LPP would be modulated in negative regulation conditions was not supported.
This diverges from previous findings showing a reduction in LPP for when decreasing emotional intensity in response to negative and positive images [@krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008; @moserElectrophysiologicalCorrelatesDecreasing2009; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @moserNeuralMarkersPositive2014].
Indeed, it is possible that our block-design paradigm with seven different regulatory conditions failed to capture such an effect, as other researchers have utilized randomized designs.
The presence of type II error also cannot be ruled out, and future replication is the only way to ascertain the presence of a true effect.
Findings for behavioral arousal and arousal ratings in regulation conditions supported our hypotheses.
Increasing emotional intensity in response to positive and negative stimuli resulted in enhanced arousal/arousal ratings compared to passively watching.
However, decrease conditions only resulted in decreased valence ratings for positive images.
It could be that our block design paradigm produced an aggregated mood manipulation effect as a result of highly arousing valenced images being presented in sequence that made it difficult to decrease emotional intensity.
This would also explain why there appears to be a successful regulation effect of increasing emotional intensity, which is underscored by the fact that only increase conditions modulated ERP components. 

Regarding our exploratory analyses with earlier visual components, the earliest effect we observed observed was the 124 ms temporal peak component between the negative increase and negative watch condition.
This effect precedes all reactivity effects found in the previous aim and challenges the notion of emotion regulation implying change from *initial* reactivity [@lewisAdvancesProblemsChallenges2010a].
This begs the question: does emotion reactivity necessarily precede regulation?
More research is needed to adequately address this question, though it appears that our findings support Joormann's and Stanton's assertion that disentangling the two processes is complex, and they may share overlap in terms of chronometry [@joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a].
Exploratory analyses investigating earlier ERP components revealed regulatory effects for the negative 259 ms temporal loading peak component for the negative and positive increase conditions.
Effects on N170 and EPN have been observed as a result of implicit emotion regulation [e.g., @gyurakExplicitImplicitEmotion2011; @liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018].
Interestingly, some researchers have noted implicit emotion regulation effects only on N170 and not EPN [@wangTemporalCourseImplicit2017].
This suggests there may be distinct neural time courses of implicit and explicit emotion regulation.
Future research should seek to elucidate upon these differences in more depth.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate such an effect with explicit emotion regulation strategies.
Overall, this pattern of findings suggests that emotion regulation and reactivity processes are not constrained to one time window or ERP component. 
Further, it does not appear that there is a clear start and end point for either process.
For example, while regulatory effects were observed at an early 259 ms component, they were not present in some later LPP-like component.
Rather than asking *when* emotion regulation begins or ends, a better question may be  *what* processes are modified.
These individual processes may begin and end at different time points and may be sensitive to experimental paradigm, valence of the emotion that is being regulated, and the type of regulation technique being employed.
This is a question well-suited to PCA, which in the authors' opinion, should be more commonly utilized in ERP research and a staple in the ERP researcher's toolbox [@dienERPPCAToolkit2010; @donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978].

Regarding our third aim regarding individual differences, PA nor capacity to savor the moment influenced the relation between viewing conditions and EEG components.
This is a departure from earlier fMRI research investigating correlations between neural activation in response to pleasant stimuli/happy faces and the personality trait of extraversion [@canliAmygdalaResponseHappy2002; @canliFMRIStudyPersonality2001].
This discrepancy could be due to different methods.
Canli et al. (2001, 2002) utilized fMRI and presented five blocks of four pictures that were presented for 7.5 seconds each while the present study used EEG and utilized seven blocks of 40 image blocks that were presented for two seconds each.
fMRI does not have the temporal resolution necessary to analyze timing in the 0 – 3000 ms time window as the present study did.
Thus, it is possible that different components were being analyzed in Canli et al. (2001, 2002) and the present study.
Furthermore, Canli et al. (2001) limited their sample to only women on the grounds that, “...they are more likely to report intense emotional experiences (Shields, 1991) and because they show more physiological reactivity in concordance with arousal judgments than men (Lang, Greenwald, Bradley, & Hamm, 1993).” 
In contrast, the present study recruited participants regardless of gender to facilitate generalizability.
Of note, a significant moderating effect of PA was found when analyzing difference in behavioral arousal scores between passively viewing positive vs. neutral images, such that those reporting higher levels of PA tended to endorse more positive state mood manipulations after passively viewing the positive image block.
This suggests that PA may be a viable clinical intervention target for those with mood disorders, such as depression, which is marked by a negative emotional disposition [@beckCognitiveTherapyEmotional1979] and is further supported by research suggesting that positive emotions are as important an intervention target as negative emotions in treating depression [@demyttenaereWhatImportantBeing2015; @dunnChangesPositiveNegative2019].
Of note is a recent study published by Wilson and MacNamara [-@wilsonSavorMomentWillful2021] where the authors found an LPP effect in a savoring paradigm.
While our study did not find a moderating effect of savoring on viewing condition and ERP components, our findings largely align with Wilson's and MacNamara's.
Wilson and MacNamara adopted a novel paradigm that instructed participants to savor positive IAPS stimuli, with language borrowed from Bryant's [@bryantFourfactorModelPerceived1989; @bryantSavoringNewModel2007] conceptualization of savoring.
This condition is most similar to our positive increase condition (see supplementary materials for instructions used in the present experiment), which did elicit a greater LPP-like component and behavioral ratings when compared to a passive viewing positive stimulus condition.
However, our instructions prompted participants to reappraise the images in a manner that elicited greater emotional intensity, while Wilson and MacNamara were careful not to adopt such instructions on the basis that the cognitive demands of reappraisal may actually contradict the goal of increasing emotional intensity.
This may explain why our later LPP component with a 740 ms temporal peak loading was not modulated as a result of regulatory condition, while Wilson and MacNamara found such an effect at a parieto-occipital LPP site occurring in the 1,000 - 6,000 ms time window using windowed averages. 
Indeed, a reason why a moderating effect was not found in the present study is because our paradigm did not tap into a savoring construct.
Future researchers would benefit from incorporating elements of Wilson and MacNamara's study as well as ours: inspection of earlier EEG components, examination of the relation among psychological questionnaire data (e.g.,, the SBI) and psychophysiological data, use of PCA rather than windowed averages, and employing paradigms instructions designed to more directly tap into the psychological constructs of interest.

<!-- This may be attributed to the present study's use of a block design paradigm where neural signals may partly reflect aggregated mood effects over the course of each experimental block, which is underscored by correlations among these early components and behavioral arousal ratings. -->
<!-- Future research should consider time-frequency and source analysis analysis to disentangle constituent components and neural source generators. -->

There several limitations to the present study.
The psychophysiological data collected are cross-sectional and causation cannot be inferred.
While we have done our best to adhere to open science principles, some hypotheses were not preregistered.
Further, software used for EEG reduction is closed source (BESA; Scherg & Berg, 1990).
While we are unable to share materials or code that can replicate our data reduction analyses, we have provided step-by-step instructions that were used for data reduction.
Lastly, the present study’s exclusionary criteria (only recruited participants who were right-handed, not color-blind, and learned English as a first language) and reliance on a convenience sample mostly comprised of Caucasian college students limits ability to generalize findings to a more diverse population.
Future research should investigate the neural correlates of positive emotion regulation in more diverse samples.
Much research on this topic (the present study included) relies on convenience samples [e.g., @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @kimNeuralCorrelatesPositive2007; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].

Research indicates that past adverse experiences may contribute to one’s capacity to savor present events [@croftTribulationsAppreciationExperiencing2014].
An interesting future line of inquiry may examine if past experiences predict certain patterns of neural activity in response to emotional stimuli.
Additionally, research indicates that psychopathology influences emotion regulation and salience of emotional stimuli [@ehringEmotionRegulationVulnerability2010; @gotlibAttentionalBiasesNegative2004; @hamiltonNeuralSubstratesIncreased2008; @joormannEmotionRegulationDepression2010; @joormannEmotionRegulationDepression2014].
Future research should investigate how depression and anxiety influence neural activity in response to passively viewing and regulating one’s emotion in response to affective stimuli.

It may be that the EEG components measured in the present study are not capturing mechanisms most relevant to savoring or PA.
Thus, future research should consider utilizing different EEG methods.
For example, source analysis is able to identify subcortical neural source generators of EEG activity.
Considering that savoring is a form of emotion regulation, it may be related to structures implicated in metacognition, such as the ACC.
Another method to consider is time-frequency analysis, which is able to simultaneously measure signals in time and frequency domains.
Frontal EEG alpha band frequency asymmetry has been observed at rest in those with depression [@gotlibEEGAlphaAsymmetry1998; @keuneApproachingDysphoricMood2013; @stewartFrontalEEGAsymmetry2011; @thibodeauDepressionAnxietyResting2006], and research has also shown correlations between reductions of frontal alpha band EEG frequency and decreased depression symptomatology [@zotevCorrelationAmygdalaBOLD2016].
Considering that low PA is theorized to be a specific risk factor for depression [@clarkTripartiteModelAnxiety1991; @kendallProspectiveAssociationsLow2015; @lewinsohnPleasantActivitiesDepression1973; @raesDampeningPositiveAffect2012; @watsonTestingTripartiteModel1995; @watsonTestingTripartiteModel1995a] and related to exacerbated depressive symptomatology [@clarkTripartiteModelAnxiety1991; @davidsonAffectiveStyleAffective1998a; @watsonExtraversionPsychopathologyFacetlevel2015], it may be associated with less left frontal EEG alpha-band frequency.

This is one of the first studies to examine the neural time course of affective processing using the OASIS.
Results indicate that it is an appropriate replacement for the IAPS.
Future researchers would be wise to utilize the OASIS in order to facilitate comparison of results across studies and capitalize on its high quality, open access, and up-to-date stimuli.
Results of the present study did not support the hypotheses that PA and capacity to savor the moment alter the relationship between passively viewing and increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images, respectively.
However, findings illustrated that EPN and LPP may be selectively enhanced in response to upregulating positive emotion and negative emotion, respectively. 
Additionally, findings indicated that PA may play a role in moderating state mood manipulations in response to positive stimuli, which may have important clinical implications for those with mood disorders.
Additionally, future aims have been identified based on these findings, such as examining the role that past experiences/psychopathology play in neural affective processing, recruiting a more diverse sample, and utilizing different EEG methods (e.g., source analysis, time frequency analysis) to study how the neural time course of affective processing varies depending on emotional arousal, and how these time courses interact with PA and savoring capacity.
The study is limited by its use of cross-sectional data, precluding causal inference, and a sample predominately comprised of Caucasian college students that limits generalizability.
Regardless of these limitations, the present study brings attention to the often-neglected study of positive emotion and its neural correlates.
Past research on affective processing has overwhelmingly focused on negative emotion.
This work is useful for mitigating the effects of unpleasant emotion but may not benefit individuals in need of bolstered levels of positive emotion.
Uncovering the biological implementations of positive emotion will be crucial for developing therapeutic and pharmacological interventions for those suffering from psychological and physiological ailments.
It may also bring us a step closer to harnessing the mechanisms of wellbeing.
