## NEURAL CHRONOMETRY OF EMOTION REACTIVITY AND REGULATION
Healthy emotion regulation abilities are integral to wellbeing [@grossEmergingFieldEmotion1998; @grossEmotionRegulationMental1995; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009; @sapolskyStressStressrelatedDisease2007].
Emotion regulation refers to psychological processes that influence an initial emotional response [@lewisAdvancesProblemsChallenges2010a], including modulation of positive and negative affective states [@koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009].
This also includes attenuating upsetting, or enhancing positive aspects, of a situation [@grossEmergingFieldEmotion1998].
Emotion regulation and reactivity are interrelated constructs. 
An individual’s ability to regulate emotions is predicated upon emotion reactivity, or how an individual experiences an initial baseline affective response to a stimulus, which spans feelings, behavioral manifestations, and bodily reactions [@grossEmotionRegulationConceptual2007]. 
Emotion regulation implies that a change has occurred from baseline reactivity to an affective stimulus.
Poor emotion regulation strategies are associated with a myriad of risks for poor health and wellbeing, including worsened social functioning [e.g., avoidance of close relationships, few positive relationships, and disinclination to share emotions with others; @grossAntecedentandResponsefocusedEmotion1998; @grossEmotionRegulationAffective2002; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009], as well as lower self-esteem and life satisfaction [@grossAntecedentandResponsefocusedEmotion1998; @koolePsychologyEmotionRegulation2009; @ochsnerRethinkingFeelingsFMRI2002].
Poor emotion regulation is also associated with bullying and victimization among youth [@walcottRelationDisinhibitionEmotion2004], physical ailments such as hypertension and coronary heart disease [@hintonMechanismsEfficacyCBT2009; @jorgensenElevatedBloodPressure1996], exacerbated cortisol reactivity to stressors [@wirtzLowSocialSupport2006], and impaired cognitive functioning [@keenanEmotionDysregulationRisk2000; @ochsnerRethinkingFeelingsFMRI2002].
Further, many types of psychopathology such as depression [@bylsmaMetaanalysisEmotionalReactivity2008a; @joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a], bipolar disorder [@townsendEmotionProcessingRegulation2012], and schizophrenia [@straussEmotionRegulationAbnormalities2013] involve dysfunctions in emotion regulation and/or reactivity. 

Disentangling emotion reactivity and regulation is complex [@joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a], and these two constructs share considerable temporal overlap in terms of affective chronometry [@davidsonReactivityRecoveryRegulation2018].
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a psychophysiological method that can be used to evaluate the chronometry of reactivity and regulation processes. 
In particular, event-related potentials (ERPs) facilitate assessment of neural responses to affective stimuli with millisecond temporal resolution [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
The present study used EEG methods to investigate the temporal course of reactivity and regulation of visual affective stimuli, with the broader translational aim of informing innovative development of psychological treatments and interventions designed to support positive health and wellbeing outcomes.

Previous psychophysiological research has typically focused on either the neural correlates of reactivity *or* regulation, within positive *or* negative valence task conditions, which has precluded researchers from identifying a comprehensive picture of the temporal course of reactivity and regulation in the context of both positive and negative valence.
Incorporating negative and positive stimuli in emotion reactivity and regulation paradigms facilitates comparison of reactivity and regulation conditions across valenced stimuli.
Thus, in the present study, we implemented an experimental paradigm where participants were shown blocks of images of varying valence levels (positive, negative, and neutral) with different regulation instructions (increase/decrease emotional intensity in response to images, or passively watching).
As explained in more detail in the method section, we implemented a principal components analysis (PCA) approach to identifying ERP components [@dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012; @donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978], and previous research on the neural correlates of emotion reactivity and regulation contributed to informing our selection of components.
The present study is inherently exploratory given the novel application of PCA of PCA to identify ERP components in the context of our study paradigm.
Below, we provide a brief overview of relevant ERP components (ranging from early to late) that have been implicated in emotion reactivity and regulation. 
We also outline expected patterns of results regarding these components based on extant literature.

#### Early Visual ERP Components Associated with Affective Processing
The N170 and early posterior negativity (EPN) are early visual EEG components that are modulated by affective stimuli [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].
The N170 is a negative peak observed at bilateral occipito-temporal electrode sites, occurring approximately 170 ms following stimulus presentation [@blauFacespecificN170Component2007].
A network of posterior neural structures of the extrastriate visual cortex appear to contribute to the N170 [@haxbyDistributedHumanNeural2000]. 
These structures include the occipital/fusiform face areas and the superior temporal sulcus in the lateral temporal cortex [@haxbyDistributedHumanNeural2000].
However, precise identification of brain structures associated with N170 remains unclear, and it is likely that N170 is the product of concomitant activation across various brain regions that are dynamically recruited contingent upon the task at hand [@calderUnderstandingRecognitionFacial2005; @hoffmanDistinctRepresentationsEye2000].

The N170 has commonly been observed in response to facial stimuli and is thought to reflect rapid structural encoding of faces, with increased N170 amplitude associated with threat-related and positive facial expressions compared to neutral facial expressions [@blauFacespecificN170Component2007; @dasilvaDissociatingNeuralTime2016; @stockdaleInfluenceStimulusValence2020].
Some research indicates comparable N170 amplitude for positive and negative facial expressions, while other studies show enhanced N170 amplitude for negative compared to positive facial expressions [for a review, see @hinojosaN170SensitivityFacial2015; @stockdaleInfluenceStimulusValence2020].
Enhanced (i.e., more negative) N170 amplitude has also been observed in response to negatively-valenced complex affective images [i.e., IAPS; @bekhterevaAttentionalBiasAffective2015], albeit with a slightly later peak latency compared to face stimuli (160 - 200 ms for face stimuli and 200 - 240 ms for IAPS).
Limited, if any research, has studied patterns of N170 activity evoked by positive affective images (beyond facial expressions), and identifying the temporal course of early neural response to both positive and negative affective stimuli is important for advancing treatment and intervention for psychological disorders hallmarked by transdiagnostic dimensions of dysregulated emotion reactivity and regulation. 
In the present study, we expected enhanced N170-like activity in response to both positive and negative stimuli.

While studies have generally shown that N170 is sensitive to valence rather than arousal, the EPN has been observed in response to emotionally arousing compared to neutral stimuli in the 200 - 300 ms window over bilateral occipital-parietal sites [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000; @schuppAttentionEmotionERP2003]. 
Potential neural generators of the EPN are located in the occipital cortex and may also include contributions from parietal regions [@wiensNonemotionalFeaturesSuppress2011].
Yoon and colleagues [-@yoonEnhancedEarlyPosterior2016] found that EPN amplitude in response to happy and fearful faces was augmented (i.e., enhanced negativity) compared to neutral faces in healthy control participants.
Individual differences, including psychopathology symptoms, also modulate the EPN. 
For example, individuals with anxiety disorders exhibited greater EPN amplitude in response to fearful compared to happy and neutral faces, suggesting that anxiety may specifically enhance response to fearful faces [@yoonEnhancedEarlyPosterior2016].

Other research has observed augmented EPN amplitude in response to pleasant compared to unpleasant complex emotional stimuli, suggesting a "pleasure bias" [@frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019].
EPN has been observed across a variety of different tasks, inter-stimulus intervals (ISI), and stimulus presentation durations [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008], leading researchers to surmise that EPN reflects relatively automatic processes observed even when processing resources are limited due to rapid presentation rates [@junghoferFleetingImagesNew2001; @schuppAttentionEmotionERP2003; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
This sensitivity to affective stimuli may index rapid affective amygdala processing of emotionally salient information [@ledouxEmotionCluesBrain1995; @morrisConsciousUnconsciousEmotional1998] and is also theorized to index selective attention where evaluation of image features is contingent upon affectively arousing perceptual characteristics for additional processing [@dolcosEventrelatedPotentialsEmotional2002; @schuppSelectiveProcessingBriefly2004].
Thus, highly arousing positive and negative images, may elicit augmented EPN amplitude.
Given the limited research on explicit emotion regulation and EPN/N170, analyses regarding regulation blocks were conducted in an exploratory manner.

#### Slow Wave Components Associated with Affective Processing and Individual Differences
Research using EEG has implicated the LPP, a sustained positive slow wave observed starting as early as 300 ms following stimuli onset, as an established index of evaluative congruency and arousal [@olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008].
Research has consistently shown that LPP over the centroparietal cortex is augmented in response to unpleasant and pleasant compared to neutral images [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @dillonDissociationEventrelatedPotentials2006; @fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008; @hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @hajcakTemporalDynamicsEmotion2007; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003].
LPP is most pronounced for images that are rated as highly arousing [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007].
LPP has been theorized to reflect activation of a brain network engaged in processing affective visual stimuli, including subcortical structures, particularly the amygdala [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @keilLargescaleNeuralCorrelates2002; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008; @schuppEmotionalFacilitationSensory2003], which is corroborated by considerable input and output connections connecting the visual cortex to amygdaloid nuclei in primates [@amaralAnatomicalOrganizationPrimate1992].
Increased levels of self-reported arousal and valence in response to stimuli is associated with augmented LPP amplitude [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000; @thiruchselvamTemporalDynamicsEmotion2011; @trittIdeologicalReactivityPolitical2016].
In sum, the LPP is sensitive to the arousal and valence of emotional stimuli.
We accordingly expected augmented LPP in response to both positive and negative images.

Enhanced LPP has been observed when participants described affective images in more negative (compared to neutral) terms [@fotiDeconstructingReappraisalDescriptions2008] and when participants were instructed to evaluate images in affective (compared to non-affective) conditions [@hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006].
Other research has shown reduced LPP when participants suppressed emotional intensity in response to viewing highly arousing affective images [e.g., @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
However, research has not reliably demonstrated that LPP is enhanced when participants are instructed to enhance their emotional intensity in response to negative [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] and positive [@krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008] affective stimuli.
However, increases in centroparietal and frontal LPP were observed when participants were asked to savor (i.e., upregulate) positive images compared to passively viewing images [@wilsonSavorMomentWillful2021].
Thus, we expected LPP modulations congruent with the regulatory goals.

#### Disentangling overlapping neural processes implicated in reactivity and regulation: A principal components approach
Nearly all of the ERP research reviewed above involved submitting windowed averages, or area measures to statistical analyses, which is a common practice in ERP research. 
However, this method may be inadequate in dealing with the thorny issue of components that overlap temporally [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978; @fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009], which is of primary consideration in this present study since a primary aim of this study is to investigate the *temporal* courses associated with emotion reactivity and regulation.
Indeed, there is speculation that N170 modulation due to emotional expressions may be due to superimposed EPN activity [@relleckeEmotionEffectsN1702013].
Similarly, LPP may overlap with P3, a parietally maximal component peaking in the 300-400 ms window that is sensitive to task relevant and motivationally significant stimuli [@polichCognitiveBiologicalDeterminants1995], and even later portions of EPN [@schuppSelectiveProcessingBriefly2004].
To address this issue, we used a exploratory temporal principal components analysis (PCA) to isolate distinct ERP components across time.
PCA is a dimension reduction technique that identifies a new set of variables that are linear combinations of the original variables.
In the context of ERPs, these new variables represent latent components that may not be apparent by visually inspecting ERP averages.
For example, if there were two temporally overlapping ERP components with equal magnitude but opposite directionality (positive and negative), the two components would negate each other and not be observable via inspection of grand average ERPs.
Temporal PCA, on the other hand, would extract these components provided that the experimental paradigm reliably produces them.

### The Present Study
The present study was designed to evaluate the temporal course of emotion reactivity and regulation to positive and negative stimuli, using EEG methods.
Our experimental paradigm included 120 different standardized complex affective stimuli (40 positive, 40 neutral, and 40 positive) from the OASIS (Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS) data set [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
Participants were given directions to increase or decrease (i.e., upregulate or downregulate) emotional intensity in response to positive and negative images, as well as to passively view them.
Participants also passively viewed the block of 40 neutral images for a total of seven regulatory blocks.
Using an exploratory PCA approach, we examined the evoked neural response to each regulatory block.
We expected that highly arousing positive and negative compared to neutral stimuli would be associated with enhanced ERP components retained from the PCA (e.g., approximating N170, EPN, LPP).
Related, indicative of an arousal effect, we expected reduced LPP in decrease blocks relative to passive watch conditions, and increased LPP in increase blocks relative to passive watch conditions. 
Analyses of regulatory effects on ERN/N170 were conducted in an exploratory manner.
All data and R code are available on the Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/p5ba9/](https://osf.io/p5ba9/).

## Method 
### Participants
54 participants were recruited from a college campus for the study (*n* = 29 women, *n* = 2 non-binary). 
Participants ranged in age from 18-29 (*M* = 19.84 years, *SD* = 1.95). 
The sample was 70.6% white, 17.6% Asian, 2.0% Black or African American, and 7.8% multiracial (2.0% declined to answer); 9.8% reported that they were Hispanic/Latinx and 90.2% were not Hispanic/Latinx. 
Two participants were not included in subsequent analyses due to missing EEG or questionnaire data.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and informed consent was provided to all participants prior to beginning the experiment.

### Materials and Procedure
#### Emotion Task Paradigm
The study used 120 different Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS) images [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
The OASIS is a collection of 900 high quality images collected from open-access online sources depicting a range of categories (people. animals, objects, & scenes).
The OASIS  was normed on arousal ratings collected from a diverse sample recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
However, the International Affective Picture System [IAPS; @langInternationalAffectivePicture2008] was used in a majority of the aforementioned research.
The IAPS was developed to provide a standardized stimulus set of complex affective images to facilitate the comparison of results across different studies and enhance replication across research groups [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007].
IAPS images are rated with respect to arousal (negative-to-positive) and arousal (low-to-high) on a nine-point visual analogue scale.
The copyright agreement that accompanies the IAPS mandates that users cannot place any of the images on computer-accessible websites.
This poses considerable restraint on increasing reliance on online samples in behavioral research that make data collection from large and diverse samples faster, less costly, and more efficient [@berinskyEvaluatingOnlineLabor2012; @buhrmesterAmazonMechanicalTurk2011; @krautPsychologicalResearchOnline2004; @masonConductingBehavioralResearch2012; @paolacciRunningExperimentsAmazon2010].
There are also concerns about lack of diversity and inclusion with regard to the initial normative development of the IAPS [@villanuevaChangeHorizonCall2021].
We selected the OASIS for the present study given that the updated norming process included a more diverse sample of participants, and the use of the OASIS facilitates comparison of results with research that goes beyond the traditional walls of a research laboratory.

During the emotion task, participants viewed seven blocks of 40 images (280 total trials).
Forty of the images were positive, 40 were neutral, and 40 were negative.
The mean normative arousal ratings (on a scale of one to seven) from the OASIS data set were 5.71, 4.09, and 2.18 for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.
All OASIS images were rated on seven point Likert scales in terms of their valence (negative to positive) and arousal (not arousing to very arousing) using a sample recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk [@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017].
The image categories (positive, neutral, and negative) from the OASIS selected for the present study each varied in terms of normative valence ratings.
The negative and positive stimuli categories were matched on arousal ratings. 
The mean normative valence ratings of the images used in the present study from Kurdi and colleague's (2017) norming study (on a scale of one to seven) were 5.71, 4.09, and 2.18 for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.
The mean normative arousal ratings of the images used in the present study from Kurdi and colleague's (2017) norming study (on a scale of one to seven) were 4.46, 1.99, and 4.52, for positive, neutral, and negative pictures, respectively.
Each block represented an experimental regulation condition: increase (positive/negative), decrease (positive/negative), and watch (positive/negative/neutral).
During the increase condition, participants were instructed to appraise the stimulus image in a way that will intensify the emotion that they are experiencing.
During the decrease condition, participants were asked to reduce the intensity of the emotion that they are experiencing.
When prompted to watch the stimuli, participants were asked to simply view the picture as they would naturally without consciously attempting to modify their affective response to it.
The passive “watch” blocks served as baseline conditions for LPP component analyses [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
A key reason that a block design was selected for this study was because arousing positive and negative images outnumber the neutral images two-to-one, and the lower arousing neutral stimuli may produce a P3 if intermixed with higher arousing (e.g., positive/negative) stimuli in the same block [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000]. 
Further, a block design paradigm may better emulate the natural environment, as stimuli of congruent arousal are typically encountered in clusters rather than isolation [@schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012]; however, research comparing intermixed and block designs for LPP and EPN have shown comparable findings between the two approaches [@pastorAffectivePicturePerception2008; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2012].

At the beginning of the task, participants completed three practice trials that consisted of 10 images that are not used elsewhere during the task [@hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006].
Participants were instructed to increase or decrease emotional arousal in response to a mixture of positive and negative images, respectively.
Participants were also asked to watch a third practice trial comprised of positive, negative, and neutral images.
Stimuli were presented in random order within each block.
Prior to each practice trial, participants were provided with instructions on how to regulate (increase/decrease) their affective response to the stimuli, or to simply view the stimuli [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006].
Participants were instructed which regulation strategy to engage in (increase, decrease, or watch) at the start of each experimental block.
Once the participant was ready, an OASIS stimulus appeared for 2000 ms [@fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009; @hajcakPersistenceAttentionEmotion2008].
Following stimulus offset, a blank screen appeared for 500 ms followed by a fixation cross for 1500 ms (± 250 ms) for a total ISI of 1750 - 2250 ms (see Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image-1) for a visual depiction of the experimental paradigm used in the present study).
This interval is identical to other studies that used the IAPS and investigated LPP [@dunningSeeNoEvil2009; @hajcakMotivatedControlledAttention2009].
Stimuli within each block were presented in random order.
Each block was separated by a break and presented in pseudo-random order, such that no valence (i.e., positive or negative) nor regulation (i.e., increase, decrease, or watch) conditions were presented consecutively.
After each experimental block, valence and arousal ratings were collected using a seven-point likert scale and the same instructions used in Kurdi, Lozano, and Banaji’s [-@kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] norming study of the OASIS stimuli set.
Furthermore, task difficulty ratings on a seven-point likert scale were also obtained.
These ratings were obtained to measure mood manipulation (in terms of valence and arousal) at the end of each experimental block.
Furthermore, difficulty ratings on a seven-point likert scale were also obtained, as to measure the degree of difficulty that participants experienced with each experimental block's instructions.
Affective visual stimuli elicit increased arousal and valence self-report ratings [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017; @olofssonAffectivePictureProcessing2008] and are sensitive to reappraisal [e.g., @thiruchselvamTemporalDynamicsEmotion2011].
Thus, we conducted exploratory analyses with self-report ratings as the dependent variable and block type as the independent variable.

### Apparatus and Physiological Recording
Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) was measured while participants completed an emotion regulation task (Figure \@ref(fig:paradigm-image-1)).
Participants were seated in a comfortable chair, approximately 24 inches from a 24-inch LCD monitor in a quiet, dimly lit room.
The viewing distance was approximately 24 in. and occupied 25° of the vertical visual angle and 30° horizontally (Cuthbert et al., 2000; Hajcak & Nieuwenhuis, 2006).
The experiment was computer-administered using E-Prime 2.0 software [@schneiderEPrimeUserGuide2002] in order to manipulate the timing and presentation of stimuli.
All stimuli were presented in color and occupied the entirety of the 21-inch monitor.
Participants were monitored by a task administrator in a nearby room and received task instructions by intercom.
EEG data were recorded using a Biosemi Active2 EEG system.
A custom-designed Falk Minow 64-channel cap with equidistantly spaced BioSemi active Ag and AgCl electrodes was used for data collection.
CMS/DRL was placed near the vertex, and two electrodes were located on the mastoid bones.
After placement of the electrode cap, electrode positions were digitized.
An additional electrode was placed on the inferior edge of the orbit of each eye to monitor vertical eye movements; nearby electrodes in the cap (lateral to each eye) monitored horizontal eye movements.
Data were recorded with a band pass of 0 – 104 Hz at a sampling rate of 512 Hz.

### EEG Data Reduction: PCA Approach
The following EEG data processing steps were implemented in Brain Electrical Source Analysis software [BESA, Version 7; @schergBESABrainElectric1990].
Following the adaptive artifact correction method [@illeArtifactCorrectionOngoing2002], ocular artifacts were corrected using a spatial PCA filter.
EEG data were re-referenced to the [@hajcakAttendingAffectAppraisal2006; @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006]  average reference of all electrodes for analyses and digitally filtered with 0.01 Hz high-pass and 30 Hz low-pass filters with a cutoff attenuation of 12 dB/octave.
EEG data were re-referenced to the average activity of all electrodes.
While it is convention to re-reference data to average activity of the mastoids for LPP analysis, a covariance matrix was utilized in the PCA, which is inherently mean corrected [@dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012].
Thus, minimal effects would be expected as a function of referencing scheme for temporal PCA [though this is not the case for spatial PCA; see @dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012].
Muscle activity and other artifacts were corrected through implementing an algorithmic scan of continuous EEG data in BESA (fixed threshold criteria: amplitude > 120 uV; gradient > 75 uV, low signal <.01 uV).
Data were baseline-adjusted by subtracting the average activity for 200 milliseconds [@moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006] before stimulus onset.

To discriminate among temporal sources of variance across the time course of ERPs, ERP averages were submitted to a temporal PCA to derive linear combinations of data that distinguish activity across time points. 
A temporal PCA was performed using the Psych package [@revellePsychProceduresPsychological2020] in R version 4.0.3 [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2020] with a covariance matrix.
A covariance matrix was used to retain the original units of measurement (i.e., voltage) for the average ERPs for each time point [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978].
The temporal PCA used all time points (-200 ms - 2000 ms) as variables and all 55 participants, seven stimuli blocks, and 66 recording sites as observations, yielding linear combinations of time points and "temporal" factors [@dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012].
To determine the number of components to retain for rotation, a parallel analysis [@hornRationaleTestNumber1965] was performed on the resultant Scree plot.
The parallel analysis creates Scree plots of the actual and simulated fully random data to determine the number of components that explain more variance than if only chance alone were acting. 
Based on the parallel analysis, 22 components were retained for rotation. 
An Promax rotation was then used on the 22 components because it does not impose orthogonality, and simulation studies suggest that Promax is most effective for temporal PCA [@dienERPPCAToolkit2010; @dienEvaluationPCAICA2007].
The time course of each of the 22 components was inspected by plotting the covariance loadings along each time point.
Given the a priori nature of the ERP components of interest, those PCA components with covariance loadings in time windows that fit descriptions of LPP and early visual components (e.g., N170, EPN) were retained for further analyses.

Spatial information is retained in PCA; the topography of each factor is encoded in the mean amplitude of factor scores at each recording site [@dienAddressingMisallocationVariance1998].
Thus, scalp topographies of each component for each condition was inspected to determine correspondence of components and ERP components of interest.
Five components were extracted for statistical analyses based on inspection of topographic plots and ERP waveforms.
Two of the retained components represented LPP-like components that have positive peaks at 381 ms and 740 ms with the former demonstrating activity at PO7 and PO8 electrode sites and the latter at PO7, PO8, PO3, PO4, P1, P2, P5/P3, P6/P4 and Pz electrode sites. 
Three components represented early visual components with positive peaks at 124 ms, 162 ms, and 259 ms with activity at PO7 and PO8 electrodes sites.
While no a priori hypotheses were made regarding ERP components occurring as early as 124 ms, we decided to retain the component for exploratory analyses.
While the time course of the 162 ms component corresponded to N170, the positive directionality of the waveform did not.
Two components with temporal loading peaks 259 ms were retained: a positive component noted earlier and a negative component at CPz and Pz electrodes sites, which represents EPN.
No frontal LPP component was identified.
See Figures \@ref(fig:erp-image-1) and \@ref(fig:erp-image-2) for grand average ERPs before and after PCA (collapsed across all blocks) as well as the top two rows of Figure \@ref(fig:contrast-plot) for grand average topographic plots before and after PCA.

## Results
### Analytic Strategy
Analyses were run in R version 4.0.3 [@R-base].
Multilevel modeling (MLM) analyses were conducted using the lme4 package [@batesFittingLinearMixedeffects2015].
All linear mixed models were estimated using REML with participants included as random intercepts.
Model assumptions were checked via visual inspection of diagnostic plots (i.e., residual, QQ, scale-location, and residuals vs. leverage) generated with the performance package [@ludeckePerformanceAssessmentRegression2019].

Repeated measures ANOVA was performed using the fitted linear mixed models to probe for significant deviations from the average activity of each component and behavioral rating as a function of experimental block.
Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were implemented to account for significant departures from sphericity as tested by Mauchly's test for sphericity.
Findings are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:rm-anova-tab).
Each analysis resulted in a significant test statistic at $\alpha = .05$, signifying that block type accounted for a significant portion of the variance in each of the retained ERP components and behavioral ratings. 
Follow up pairwise *t* tests were conducted using the emmeans package [@lenthEmmeansEstimatedMarginal2020] among passive watch and regulation conditions for PCA EEG components and behavioral ratings.
Effect sizes are interpreted in accordance with Cohen's guidelines [@cohenStatisticalPowerAnalysis1988a].

### Behavioral Ratings
#### Reactivity conditions
With regard to behavioral ratings, we observed differences in arousal and valence ratings among passive watch conditions (positive, negative, and neutral).
Statistical results for behavioral ratings are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:bx-contrast-plot), and more detailed statistical findings for each comparison are provided in Appendix A of the supplementary materials.
Participants rated negative images as more arousing than positive images and positive images as more arousing than neutral images.
There were significant, medium sized reactivity effects when comparing negative and neutral conditions, as well as small effects between positive and neutral conditions and negative and positive conditions. 
Medium sized differences in valence ratings were also observed between negative and neutral conditions, small sized effects for positive and neutral conditions, as well as large differences between positive and negative conditions. 
On average, participants rated negative images more negatively than neutral images and positive images and more positively than neutral images.

#### Regulation conditions
In terms of regulation conditions, differences among passive viewing and increase (positive and negative) conditions were generally observed.
For positive regulation conditions, medium sized differences in arousal ratings were observed when comparing increase and watch conditions, as well as large differences between increase and decrease conditions. 
No significant difference was noted between the decrease and watch conditions.
Thus, while decrease conditions did not meaningfully deviate from watch conditions for positive stimuli, they did deviate from increase conditions.
Medium sized differences in valence ratings were also noted when comparing increase and watch conditions, as well as small differences between decrease and watch conditions, and large differences between the decrease and increase conditions.
In terms of negative regulation conditions, medium sized differences in arousal ratings were observed when comparing increase and watch conditions as well as increase and decrease conditions.
There was no difference between the decrease and watch conditions
Valence rating differences that were medium sized also emerged when comparing increase and watch conditions as well as decrease and increase conditions.

### EEG Results

#### 124-162 ms
Statistical results for EEG components are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:contrast-plot).
More detailed statistical findings for each comparison are provided in Appendix A of the supplementary materials.
Starting at the earliest component extracted from the PCA with a peak at 124 ms, no reactivity or positive regulatory effects were observed.
However, a small difference was noted for between the negative increase and negative watch conditions, with greater amplitudes for the negative increase relative to the negative watch condition.
This illustrates a difference in time course among regulation and reactivity starting at early neural processes.
Reactivity effects began unfolding at the 162 ms component, with medium and small differences in negative versus neutral and positive versus neutral contrasts, respectively.  
There was also a small sized effect between negative and positive images, with negative images eliciting larger 162 ms component amplitude.
No regulation effects were observed for the 162 ms component, suggesting that this component may be unique to reactivity effects.

#### 259 ms
Reactivity and regulation effects were noted at the 259 ms component.
Medium sized significant differences were noted between negative and neutral watch conditions for the negative and positive 259 ms components.
In addition, there was a small difference between positive and negative images, with negative images eliciting more negative (i.e., enhanced) 259 ms amplitude relative to positive images.
Small increase conditions were noted between increase and watch conditions for positive and negative regulatory conditions, with more negative amplitudes in increase relative to watch conditions.
Results suggest that the 259 ms is flexible to task demands (e.g., reactivity or regulation) and also marks the point at which positive emotion regulation effects begin to unfold and negative emotion regulation ends.

#### 381 ms
There were reactivity and positive regulatory effects observed at the 381 ms component.
Large and medium sized effects were observed for negative and positive stimuli relative to neutral stimuli, respectively, and negative stimuli elicited greater amplitude than positive images (small sized effect).
There was a small difference between the positive watch and positive increase conditions, with greater 381 ms component amplitude in increase conditions, as well as an additional small difference between increase and decrease conditions.

#### 740 ms
Finally, reactivity conditions were observed among positive, neutral, and negative images at the 740 ms peak that ranged from large (negative vs. neutral) to medium (positive vs. neutral, negative vs. positive).
No regulation effects were observed except for a small effect when comparing the positive increase and decrease conditions.

## DISCUSSION
We explored the neural time course of emotion reactivity and regulation with an exploratory temporal PCA approach in the present study.
We found that emotion reactivity unfolded starting at 162 ms and generally continued through the first 1000 ms following stimulus presentation, with negative stimuli consistently eliciting enhanced amplitude relative to positive stimuli.
Regarding emotion regulation, different patterns emerged that were contingent upon whether the stimuli were positive or negative, and negative regulatory effects unfolded early in the time course at 124 ms while positive regulatory effects were observed slightly later, starting at 259 ms.
Only upregulation effects were observed for positive and negative valenced conditions relative to passive watch conditions, and no downregulation effects were found.
Overall, this suggests that emotion reactivity unfolds more consistently throughout the neural time course, with enhanced activity for negative stimuli compared to positive stimuli.
Regulatory effects are smaller, and their time course is contingent upon valence.

The earliest component retained from our PCA, a positive 124 ms peak, did not display and reactivity or positive regulatory effects.
However, it is the point at which we first observed a regulatory effect for increasing affect in response to negative images (relative to passive viewing).
This finding challenges the notion of emotion regulation implying change from *initial* reactivity [@lewisAdvancesProblemsChallenges2010a] and begs the question: does emotion reactivity necessarily precede regulation?
More research is needed to adequately address this question, though it appears that our findings support Joormann's and Stanton's assertion that disentangling the two processes is complex, and they may share overlap in terms of chronometry [@joormannExaminingEmotionRegulation2016a].
This finding also indicates that negative emotion regulatory processes may be implicated earlier in the neural time course when compared to positive emotion regulation or emotion reactivity.
Interventions that aim to modify neural mechanisms of negative emotion regulatory processes should likely focus on these earlier mechanisms.

For the next extracted component at 162 ms, passively viewing positive and negative stimuli elicited amplitude relative to neutral stimuli.
Within the present study, this marks the time point at which reactivity processes begin to unfold throughout the rest of the neural time course of extracted PCA components (i.e., the first 1000 ms following stimulus presentation).
We also found that negative images elicited augmented amplitude relative to positive images (and for all subsequent components).
This pattern of findings largely fits with research investigating later slow wave components [i.e., enhanced amplitude for emotional stimuli, with greater effects for negative stimuli, e.g., @fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009; @frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019].
No regulatory effects were found for this 162 ms component, implying that activity within this time window is specific to emotion reactivity.
This also illustrates that negative emotion regulation is not necessarily a continuous process.
Rather, it is implicated at certain points in the time course.
In sum, interventions targeted at emotion reactivity may consider neural processes starting very early in, and throughout, the neural temporal course.

The next time point, 259 ms, is the sole time point in the present study where reactivity, positive emotion regulation, and negative emotion regulation effects were observed concurrently.
This implies that the 259 ms component is flexible to task demands (e.g., reactivity or regulation) and also marks the point at which positive emotion regulation effects begin to unfold and negative emotion regulation ends.
With regard to reactivity, no effect was found when comparing neutral and positive stimuli.
Rather, negative images elicited augmented amplitude relative to neutral and positive stimuli.
This contradicts a "pleasure bias" observed in another negative peak component (EPN) often observed in this time window [@frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019].
One possible explanation for this discrepancy is our use of PCA, which addresses the issue of overlapping waveforms - a problem that windowed averages are vulnerable to [@donchinMultivariateAnalysisEventrelated1978].
Concerning regulatory effects, significant differences were observed for both positive and negative stimuli, ultimately implying that early visual ERP processes may play a larger role in emotion regulation than previously surmised.
Of note, only upregulation effects were observed.
It may be that this component is specific to increasing emotional intensity, or that our paradigm was unsuccessful in eliciting downregulation effects, as indicated by null findings in other ERP components and behavioral arousal ratings.

There was a continuation of reactivity effects in the two extracted positive slow wave components at 381 ms and 740 ms.
Highly arousing positive and negative images eliciting enhanced slow wave ERPs (i.e., LPP) is a common finding in research investigating the neural time course of affective processing with the IAPS [@cuthbertBrainPotentialsAffective2000; @hajcakMotivatedControlledAttention2009; @hajcakNeuralResponseEmotional2007; @krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @schuppAffectivePictureProcessing2000; @trittIdeologicalReactivityPolitical2016].
It is also largely consistent with past research examining emotion reactivity with PCA [e.g., @fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009].
Smaller effects were found for positive images compared to negative images in the 381 ms and 740 ms components, which is also consistent with previous literature [@fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009; @frankHemodynamicElectrocorticalReactivity2019].
Of note, these findings are somewhat at odds with a 2012 study by Liu and colleagues [-@liuNeuralSubstrateLate2012] that found comparable effect sizes between positive and negative stimuli for centroparietal LPP.
Differences between the present study and Liu et al. (2012) may be attributed to different high-pass filters (.01 Hz versus .1 Hz), experimental paradigms (block vs. randomized design), and use of PCA vs. averaging of time windows. 
Future researchers should be mindful of these factors as to facilitate replicability of results.

Regulation effects were found in the 381 ms component for the positive increase condition relative to the neutral and decrease conditions.
This contrasts with previous literature reporting null findings in positive increase conditions for positive slow wave components [@krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008; @moserElectrophysiologicalCorrelatesDecreasing2009], which was attributed to a theorized ceiling effect that results from automatic capture of attentional resources by motivationally relevant stimuli.
However, our results did align with Wilson and MacNamara (2021), who adopted a novel paradigm that instructed participants to savor positive IAPS stimuli, with language consistent with Bryant's [@bryantFourfactorModelPerceived1989; @bryantSavoringNewModel2007] conceptualization of savoring.
Notably, our instructions prompted participants to reappraise the images in a manner that elicited greater emotional intensity, while Wilson and MacNamara intentionally did not use such language on the basis of the notion that the cognitive demands of reappraisal may actually contradict the goal of increasing emotional intensity.
This may explain why our 740 ms component was not modulated by regulatory condition, while Wilson and MacNamara found such an effect at a parieto-occipital LPP site occurring in the 1,000 - 6,000 ms time window using windowed averages. 
Future researchers would benefit from incorporating elements of Wilson and MacNamara's study as well as ours: inspection of earlier EEG components, use of PCA rather than windowed averages, and employing paradigms instructions designed to more directly tap into the psychological constructs of interest.
The lack of negative regulatory effects in our slow wave components is surprising given findings showing a reduction in LPP for when decreasing emotional intensity in response to negative and positive images [@krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008; @moserElectrophysiologicalCorrelatesDecreasing2009; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006; @moserNeuralMarkersPositive2014].
Indeed, it is possible that our block-design paradigm with seven different regulatory conditions failed to capture such an effect, as other researchers have utilized randomized designs.
The presence of type II error also cannot be ruled out, and future replication is the only way to ascertain the presence of a true effect.

<!-- Regarding behavioral ratings, we observed reactivity differences among all passive watch blocks with arousal and valence ratings. -->
<!-- Negative arousal ratings that were significantly larger than positive ratings, while positive ratings were larger than neutral ratings. -->
<!-- Further, valence ratings for all stimuli deviated from each other in the expected direction. -->
<!-- While positive and negative image sets were matched on normative arousal and arousal ratings in the present study, pornographic images were omitted, which are commonly rated as highly arousing positive images [@bradleyInternationalAffectivePicture2007; @kurdiIntroducingOpenAffective2017] and used in other studies investigating neural time course of affective processing with positive images [e.g., @hajcakTemporalDynamicsEmotion2007; @liuNeuralSubstrateLate2012]. -->
<!-- Thus, the omission of these images may be contributing to discrepant findings in the present study compared to others. -->

<!-- With regards to regulation effects, downregulation conditions only resulted in attenuated valence ratings for positive, but not negative, images.  -->
<!-- It could be that our block design paradigm produced an aggregated mood manipulation effect as a result of highly arousing valenced images being presented in sequence that made it difficult to decrease emotional intensity.  -->
<!-- This would also explain why there appears to be a successful regulation effect of increasing emotional intensity, which is underscored by the fact that only increase conditions modulated ERP components. -->

There several limitations to the present study.
The psychophysiological data collected are cross-sectional and causation cannot be inferred.
The present study’s exclusionary criteria (only recruited participants who were right-handed, not color-blind, and learned English as a first language) and reliance on a convenience sample mostly comprised of white college students limits ability to generalize findings to a more diverse population.
While much research on this topic (the present study included) relies on convenience samples [e.g., @hajcakReappraisalModulatesElectrocortical2006; @kimNeuralCorrelatesPositive2007; @moserIntentionalModulationEmotional2006], future research should investigate the neural correlates of positive emotion regulation across the lifespan and study diverse samples.

<!-- Past studies have illustrated relations among ERP components and self-report data such as anxiety [@yoonEnhancedEarlyPosterior2016], positive affectivity [i.e., one's disposition to experience positive emotions; @weinbergDistinctAssociationsLow2018], depression [@fotiReducedElectrocorticalResponse2010], and empathy [@stockdaleCoolCallousControl2017]. -->
<!-- Future research should investigate the relations in an effort to bridge the gap between self-report and psychophysiological data (using a PCA approach) to the end of devising neuroscience informed interventions for those with psychopathology and to bolster wellbeing. -->
<!-- To this end, future research should also consider utilizing different EEG methods. -->
<!-- For example, source analysis is able to identify subcortical neural source generators of EEG activity. -->
<!-- Considering that savoring is a form of emotion regulation, it may be related to structures implicated in metacognition, such as the ACC. -->
<!-- Another method to consider is time-frequency analysis, which is able to simultaneously measure signals in time and frequency domains. -->
<!-- Frontal EEG alpha band frequency asymmetry has been observed at rest in those with depression [@gotlibEEGAlphaAsymmetry1998; @keuneApproachingDysphoricMood2013; @stewartFrontalEEGAsymmetry2011; @thibodeauDepressionAnxietyResting2006], and research has also shown correlations between reductions of frontal alpha band EEG frequency and decreased depression symptomatology [@zotevCorrelationAmygdalaBOLD2016]. -->
<!-- Considering that low positive affectivity is theorized to be a specific risk factor for depression [@clarkTripartiteModelAnxiety1991; @kendallProspectiveAssociationsLow2015; @lewinsohnPleasantActivitiesDepression1973; @raesDampeningPositiveAffect2012; @watsonTestingTripartiteModel1995; @watsonTestingTripartiteModel1995a] and related to exacerbated depressive symptomatology [@clarkTripartiteModelAnxiety1991; @davidsonAffectiveStyleAffective1998a; @watsonExtraversionPsychopathologyFacetlevel2015], it may be associated with less left frontal EEG alpha-band frequency. -->

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study study illustrated that a cascade of early and slow wave ERP components that were modified in reactivity conditions. 
There were consistent emotion reactivity effects observed for positive and negative stimuli starting at 162 ms and generally throughout the first 1000 ms of the neural temporal course. 
Different temporal windows of regulatory effects emerged depending on stimulus valence, with negative regulatory effects unfolding from 124 ms to 159 ms, and positive regulatory effects unfolding from 259 ms to 381 ms. 
These are important considerations in devising neuroscience-informed treatments for individuals who experience dysregulated emotion reactivity and/or regulation. 
Additionally, this is one of the first studies to examine the neural time course of affective processing using the OASIS stimuli set, which includes high quality images, spans a number of semantic categories, and is open access (Kurdi et al., 2017). 
The present study provides a more holistic perspective of the time course of emotion reactivity/regulation in response to positive and negative stimuli. 
Identifying neural implementations of emotion reactivity and regulation will be crucial for developing therapeutic and pharmacological interventions for those suffering from psychological and physiological ailments. It may also bring us a step closer to harnessing the mechanisms of wellbeing.

<!-- Regarding our third aim regarding individual differences, PA nor capacity to savor the moment influenced the relation between viewing conditions and EEG components. -->
<!-- This is a departure from earlier fMRI research investigating correlations between neural activation in response to pleasant stimuli/happy faces and the personality trait of extraversion [@canliAmygdalaResponseHappy2002; @canliFMRIStudyPersonality2001]. -->
<!-- This discrepancy could be due to different methods. -->
<!-- Canli et al. (2001, 2002) utilized fMRI and presented five blocks of four pictures that were presented for 7.5 seconds each while the present study used EEG and utilized seven blocks of 40 image blocks that were presented for two seconds each. -->
<!-- fMRI does not have the temporal resolution necessary to analyze timing in the 0 – 3000 ms time window as the present study did. -->
<!-- Thus, it is possible that different components were being analyzed in Canli et al. (2001, 2002) and the present study. -->
<!-- Furthermore, Canli et al. (2001) limited their sample to only women on the grounds that, “...they are more likely to report intense emotional experiences (Shields, 1991) and because they show more physiological reactivity in concordance with arousal judgments than men (Lang, Greenwald, Bradley, & Hamm, 1993).”  -->
<!-- In contrast, the present study recruited participants regardless of gender to facilitate generalizability. -->
<!-- Of note, a significant moderating effect of PA was found when analyzing difference in behavioral arousal scores between passively viewing positive vs. neutral images, such that those reporting higher levels of PA tended to endorse more positive state mood manipulations after passively viewing the positive image block. -->
<!-- This suggests that PA may be a viable clinical intervention target for those with mood disorders, such as depression, which is marked by a negative emotional disposition [@beckCognitiveTherapyEmotional1979] and is further supported by research suggesting that positive emotions are as important an intervention target as negative emotions in treating depression [@demyttenaereWhatImportantBeing2015; @dunnChangesPositiveNegative2019]. -->
<!-- Of note is a recent study published by Wilson and MacNamara [-@wilsonSavorMomentWillful2021] where the authors found an LPP effect in a savoring paradigm. -->

<!-- This may be attributed to the present study's use of a block design paradigm where neural signals may partly reflect aggregated mood effects over the course of each experimental block, which is underscored by correlations among these early components and behavioral arousal ratings. -->
<!-- Future research should consider time-frequency and source analysis analysis to disentangle constituent components and neural source generators. -->

<!-- Research indicates that past adverse experiences may contribute to one’s capacity to savor present events [@croftTribulationsAppreciationExperiencing2014]. -->
<!-- An interesting future line of inquiry may examine if past experiences predict certain patterns of neural activity in response to emotional stimuli. -->
<!-- Additionally, research indicates that psychopathology influences emotion regulation and salience of emotional stimuli [@ehringEmotionRegulationVulnerability2010; @gotlibAttentionalBiasesNegative2004; @hamiltonNeuralSubstratesIncreased2008; @joormannEmotionRegulationDepression2010; @joormannEmotionRegulationDepression2014]. -->
<!-- Future research should investigate how depression and anxiety influence neural activity in response to passively viewing and regulating one’s emotion in response to affective stimuli. -->

<!-- While savoring is a trait-like measure of one's ability to regulate positive emotions, positive affectivity (PA) pertains to one's reactivity to positive emotions, or a trait-like disposition to recognize, attend to, and ultimately experience positive emotions [e.g., happiness, interest, energy, and self-assurance; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009]. -->
<!-- Understanding how individual differences modify the neural correlates of positive emotion reactivity/regulation may facilitate development of neuroscience-informed interventions for those with psychological problems marked by low levels of positive emotion (e.g., depression).  -->

<!-- ERP studies investigating emotion reactivity commonly incorporate both negatively- and positively-valenced stimuli.  -->
<!-- The same is not true of emotion regulation studies, where it is convention to investigate regulation conditions with only negative or positive images [e.g., @krompingerModulationsElectrophysiologicalResponse2008; @moserElectrophysiologicalCorrelatesDecreasing2009]. -->

<!-- Emotion regulation and reactivity are interrelated constructs. -->
<!-- An individual's ability to *regulate* emotions is predicated upon the capacity to attend and *react* to emotions. -->
<!-- Emotion reactivity broadly refers to an individual's initial baseline affective response to a stimulus, which spans feelings, behavioral manifestations, and bodily reactions [@grossEmotionRegulationConceptual2007].  -->
<!-- Consistent with the circumplex framework [@russellCircumplexModelAffect1980], emotion reactivity varies in arousal (not arousing to strongly arousing) and valence [negative to positive; @grossEmotionEmotionRegulation2014]. -->
<!-- Emotion regulation implies that a change has occurred from reactivity to an affective stimulus. -->
<!-- A distinction between reactivity and regulation may lie in whether the motivational significance of the emotional stimulus is being altered [@hajcakSignificanceSignificanceEmpirical2020]. -->
<!-- Emotion reactivity implies that the motivational significance of the stimulus is not being altered, while regulation (whether consciously or unconsciously) implies that it is being manipulated, and both of these processes are influenced by a host of related factors (e.g., contextual and environmental, etc.). -->

<!-- However, other research has shown that implicit emotion regulation modifies N170, but not EPN, implicating that implicit emotion regulation may be implemented in earlier perceptual stages of emotion processing rather than later selective attention stages [i.e., EPN & LPP; @wangTemporalCourseImplicit2017]. -->

<!-- Since early ERP components are modified via emotion regulation efforts, these findings further blur the conceptual lines between reactivity and regulation and are in line with previous research showing that response to visual affective stimuli observed as early as 100 ms are influenced by individual differences [e.g., empathy; @stockdaleCoolCallousControl2017]. -->
<!-- However, these findings fit well within the context of conceptualizing reactivity and regulation as a matter of altering motivational significance; though implicit emotion regulation occurs unconsciously, it still serves to manipulate significance of stimuli. -->

 

<!-- Of note, other research has supported the notion that the N170 specifically indexes structural encoding of facial features independent of emotional expression [e.g., @thierryControllingInterstimulusPerceptual2007] and that studies observing N170 modulation due to emotional expressions may be due to superimposed EPN activity [@relleckeEmotionEffectsN1702013]. -->
<!-- This suggests that neural sources for face- and emotion-related processes may be independent parallel processes [@bruceUnderstandingFaceRecognition1986; @relleckeEmotionEffectsN1702013]. -->
<!-- However, this notion is at odds with a meta-analysis conducted by Hinojosa and colleagues [-@hinojosaN170SensitivityFacial2015] that showed N170 sensitivity to facial expressions. -->
<!-- Thus, it may be that N170 and EPN may share common neural processes related to face and emotion processing, though research has generally established the former as more associated with face processing and the latter emotional processing. -->

<!-- To the author's knowledge, previous research has not investigated N170 in response to positively arousing complex visual stimuli. -->
<!-- This information may elucidate distinct neural time course patterns for positive and negative emotions that may inform treatment for psychological problems marked by dysregulated emotion reactivity and regulation. -->
<!-- Thus, it was hypothesized in the present study that highly arousing positive and negative affective images may elicit more negative N170 relative to neutral visual affective stimuli. -->

<!-- Another study observed N170/EPN enhancements and decreased self report emotional intensity ratings in an implicit emotion regulation task (i.e., a word priming task) contingent upon trait anxiety [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018], suggesting implicit emotion regulation deficits in individuals with anxiety. -->
<!-- Implicit emotion regulation is automatically evoked by stimuli and occurs unconsciously or without awareness, while explicit emotion regulation requires conscious effort (e.g., intentionally downregulating one's emotions in response to a negative stimuli). -->
<!-- For example, implicit regulation has been elicited in laboratories by presenting a valenced word prior to a stimulus of an incongruent arousal  -->
<!-- [@gyurakExplicitImplicitEmotion2011] or even via extinction of the emotional salience of a stimulus [@gottfriedHumanOrbitofrontalCortex2004]. -->
<!-- Much has been written on the distinction between explicit and implicit emotion regulation [@braunsteinExplicitImplicitEmotion2017]. -->
<!-- It is unclear to us if such a demarcation can be made between implicit regulation and reactivity, however. -->
<!-- We conjecture that implicit regulation is a form of altering emotional salience that does not require explicit, cognitive efforts. -->
<!-- Does this qualify as emotion regulation, then? -->
<!-- For example, research has demonstrated that individual differences alter emotion reactivity and regulation [e.g., empathy; @stockdaleCoolCallousControl2017; positive affectivity; @weinbergDistinctAssociationsLow2018]. -->
<!-- Since these individual differences qualify as implicit regulation, then, since they are acting without awareness? -->
<!-- Or just a factor that influences reactivity? -->
<!-- More research is needed to clarify this distinction. -->
<!-- However, other research has shown that implicit emotion regulation modifies N170, but not EPN. For example, Wang and Li [-@wangTemporalCourseImplicit2017] administered a a word matching task that primed participants for emotion control or expression, which resulted in enhanced N170 (but not EPN or LPP). -->
<!-- Given these equivocal findings and the scarce research investigating the relationship between explicit reappraisal emotion regulation strategies (as utilized in our present study), it is unclear whether early visual components are modified in explicit emotion regulation. -->

<!-- #### Individual Differences Modulate Early Visual Components -->
<!-- Though early components such as N170 and EPN have been conceptualized as relatively automatic processes, research suggests that they are influenced by individual differences. -->
<!-- For example, Stockdale and colleagues (2017) found that neural processing at 100 ms varies as a function of a modifiable individual difference (i.e., empathy). -->
<!-- Additionally, implicit regulatory effects on visual components varies based on one's trait anxiety [@liuImplicitEmotionRegulation2018]. -->
<!-- Previous research has shown relationships between extraversion [a personality trait related to PA; @costaInfluenceExtraversionNeuroticism1980; @warrIndependencePositiveNegative1983; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009] and subcortical activity in response to positive stimuli [@canliAmygdalaResponseHappy2002; @canliFMRIStudyPersonality2001]. -->
<!-- The amygdala, which is implicated in Canli and colleagues' studies (2001, 2002), is also theorized to contribute to N170 and EPN [@vuilleumierDistantInfluencesAmygdala2004]. -->
<!-- Thus, EPN activity in response to positive vs. neutral images may be contingent upon PA. -->
<!-- In light of the conceptual overlap between reactivity and regulation and lack of research investigating explicit emotion regulation's effect on early visual components, no hypotheses were made regarding the relationship between N170/EPN, regulation conditions, and savoring capacity. -->

<!-- Last, trait measures of PA and savoring capacity are associated with heightened arousal and more positive affect in response to reacting to and upregulating positive emotion, respectively [@bryantSavoringNewModel2007; @watsonPositiveAffectivity2009]. -->
<!-- Thus, it was hypothesized that the difference in behavioral/arousal ratings between passively watching positive vs. neutral images would be positively moderated by PA and the difference in behavioral/arousal ratings between increasing emotional intensity in response to positive images vs. passively watching positive images would be positively moderated by savoring capacity. -->
